0,0,W9wAfqBd_T0,How turtle shells evolved... twice - Judy Cebra Thomas,"Meet Odontochelys semitestacea. This little creature spends its days 
splashing in Late Triassic swamps with a host of other reptiles. Under the surface lies its best 
defense against attack: a hard shell on its belly. Odontochelys is an early ancestor 
of the turtle. Its half-shelled body illustrates an 
important point about the modern turtle: it actually has two shells that develop 
totally separately while the turtle is still an embryo. Both are extensions of the animal’s 
skeleton, and together they are made 
of almost 60 bones. Like other embryos, turtle embryos are made of 
undifferentiated cells that become specific cell types, and then organs and tissues, through gene activity and communication
between cells. At first, turtle embryos look very similar
to those of other reptiles, birds, and mammals, except for a bulge of cells called 
the carapacial ridge. The ridge expands around the body 
between the neck and lower back, creating a disc shape. It guides the formation of the upper part
of the turtle’s shell, called the carapace, likely by attracting 
the cells that will become ribs. Instead of curving downwards 
to make a regular rib cage, the ribs move outwards towards the 
carapacial ridge. They then secrete a signaling protein that converts surrounding cells 
into bone-forming cells. These fifty bones grow until they meet 
and connect with sutures. A ring of bone solidifies 
the carapace’s edges. The outer layer of skin cells produces 
the scales, known as scutes, that cover the carapace. The development of the bottom half 
of the shell, the plastron, is driven by neural crest cells, which can produce a variety of different 
cell types including neurons, cartilage and bone. A thick shield of these cells 
spreads across the belly, coming together in regions that produce
nine plate-like bones. Eventually, these connect to the 
carapace by sutures. A turtle’s shell has obvious advantages
for guarding against predators, but the rigid casing also presents 
some challenges. As the turtle grows, the sutures between the bones 
of the carapace and plastron spread. Most mammals and reptiles rely on a
flexible rib cage that expands to allow them to breathe, but turtles use abdominal muscles 
attached to the shell instead: one to breathe in, 
and one to breathe out. So how did the shell evolve? Though there are still gaps in the 
fossil record, the first step seems to have been 
a thickening of the ribs. The oldest known turtle ancestor, a creature called Eunotosaurus africanus, lived 260 million years ago and looked 
almost nothing like a modern turtle, but it had a set of broad, flat ribs that anchored the muscles 
of its powerful forearms. Eunotosaurus was likely 
a burrowing creature, digging homes for itself in what’s 
now southern Africa. Odontochelys semitestacea illustrates 
another, later step in turtle evolution, with thick ribs like Eunotosaurus 
plus a belly plate for protection. Our first fossil evidence of the full 
shell characteristic of modern turtles is about 210 million years old, and belongs to a species called 
Proganochelys quenstedti, whose ribs had fused. Proganochelys could move 
between water and land. Unlike modern turtles, it couldn’t retract
its head into its shell, but had defensive spines on its neck. Modern turtle shells are almost as diverse
as the turtles themselves. Sea turtles have flatter, lighter shells 
for streamlined gliding through the water. Land-dwelling tortoises, meanwhile, have domed shells that can slip free of
predators’ jaws and help them turn right-side up if 
they fall on their backs. Leatherback and softshell turtles have shells without the ring of bone 
around the edge of the carapace or the tough scutes covering it, making it easier for them to 
squeeze into tight spaces.","The video explains how turtle shells evolved twice.

1,1,Cd-artSbpXc,Why are fish fish-shaped? - Lauren Sallan,"In tropical seas, flying fish leap out of the water, gliding for up to 200 meters 
using wing-like fins, before dipping back into the sea. In the Indo-Pacific, a hunting sailfish can reach speeds 
of 110 kilometers per hour. That’s 11 times faster than Olympic 
swimming champion Michael Phelps. It can then stick up its spiny dorsal fin 
like a brake, grinding to a dead halt, mid-swim. Each of these physical feats is made 
possible by a fish’s form, which in most species is a smooth, 
elongated body, fins, and a tail. These features are shared across thousands
of fish species, each introducing its own variations on
the theme to survive in unique habitats. What makes these features so
commonplace in fish, and what does it reveal about the more 
than 33,000 fish species that inhabit earth’s rivers, 
lakes, and seas? Fish can be split into two main groups, according to the type 
of motion they favor. The first is body 
and caudal fin driven motion, and most fish species, about 85%, 
fall into this group. Here, the body and tail 
are the primary propelling forces, with fins mainly playing 
a stabilizing and steering role. This configuration suits 
many open-water species, which need speed, thrust and control for
constant, efficient swimming. Eels lie at one extreme of this group. Known as anguilliform swimmers, their entire bodies undulate to generate 
a wave-like motion. Compared to anguilliform fish, species like salmon and trout, 
known as subcarangiforms, use about two-thirds of their body mass
to generate motion, while carangiform swimmers, 
such as mackerel, only use about a third. Typically, the less of its mass a fish 
uses to generate motion, the more streamlined its shape. At the other end of the spectrum from eels
are ostraciiform species like boxfish, and thunniform swimmers like tuna. In these fish, the tails, 
also known as caudal fins, do the work. A tuna’s tail is attached by tendons 
to multiple muscles in its body. It powers the body like an engine, forcefully catapulting
the bullet-like fish to speeds up to 69 kilometers per hour. The second major fish group relies 
on median and paired fin motion, meaning they’re propelled through the 
water predominantly by their fins. Fins allow fine-tuned movement 
at slow speeds, so this propulsion 
is typically found in fish that have to navigate complex habitats. Bottom-dwelling fishes, like rays,
fall into this group; using their huge pectoral fins, they can
lift themselves swiftly off the sea floor. That conveniently allows them 
to inhabit shallow seas without being buffeted about by waves. Similarly, shallow-water flatfish 
use their entire bodies as one big fin to hoist 
themselves up off the sand. Ocean sunfish lack tails, so they move around slowly by beating 
their wing-like median fins instead. Similar movements are shared 
by many reef species, like the queen angelfish, surgeonfish, and wrasse. Their focus on fins has taken 
the demand off their bodies, many of which have consequently 
evolved into unusual and inventive shapes. There are fishes within both groups 
that seem to be outliers. But if you look closer, you’ll notice that these 
common traits are disguised. Seahorses, for instance, don’t appear 
fish-shaped in any conventional way, yet they use their flexible 
dorsal fins as makeshift tails. A pufferfish may occasionally 
look more like a lethal balloon, but if it needs to swim rapidly,
it’ll retract its spines. Handfish look like they have legs, but really these limb-like 
structures are fins, modified to help them 
amble across the sea floor. For fish, motion underpins survival, so it’s become a huge evolutionary 
driver of form. The widespread features of fish 
have been maintained across tens of thousands of fish species, not to mention other 
ocean-dwelling animals, like penguins, dolphins, sea slugs, and squids. And that’s precisely because 
they’ve proven so successful.","Fish are shaped the way they are because of the way they move. There are two main ways fish move: body and caudal fin driven motion, and median and paired fin motion. The first way is used by most fish species, and it involves the body and tail being the primary propelling forces, with fins mainly playing a stabilizing and steering role. The second way is used by fish that have to navigate complex habitats, and it involves being propelled through the water predominantly by their fins. Some fish, like seahorses and pufferfish, may not look fish-shaped in a conventional way, but they still use their fins to move. Fish have evolved this way because motion underpins their survival."
2,2,_hBAr7uJ6L8,The surprising reasons animals play dead - Tierney Thys,"Imagine you’re being attacked 
by a ferocious predator. With no chance of escape, you do what any courageous, 
self-respecting possum would do: curl into an immobile 
state called catatonia, stick out your tongue, drool, and ooze some foul-smelling 
liquid from your anal glands. Disgusted, your assailant 
loosens its grip, decides you’re not the dinner 
it was looking for, and departs. After 10 minutes, 
you resurrect and merrily saunter on. From lemurs to lizards, ants to amphibians, sharks to chickens, hundreds of animals
""play dead"" as a survival tactic. Nicknamed ""playing possum"" 
after its star performer, feigning death is also called thanatosis. That’s from Thanatos, 
the ancient Greek deity of death. But most scientists call it 
tonic immobility, or TI. How and why TI occurs depends 
on the species and situation. Spewing stench and adopting odd postures
are common and often play important roles. Other animals sacrifice their neighbors: quail chicks that freeze 
while their kin run amok have a better chance of survival 
when pursued by a cat. Speaking of cats, feline mothers can pinch
the napes of their kittens’ necks and induce another kind of 
immobility called clipnosis. This keeps their kittens quiet 
and easy to transport. Most of the physiological mechanisms 
underlying these theatrics originate in 
the parasympathetic nervous system, better known for controlling cycles 
of resting and digesting. In possums, the parasympathetic nervous system causes
their heart rates to drop by nearly half, respiration by a third, and body temperatures by more than half a
degree Celsius for up to an hour. The neurotransmitter dopamine 
also plays a part. Flour beetles with low dopamine levels 
play dead more frequently than those with high levels, and anything blocking dopamine receptor 
sites can lengthen catatonia. But maintaining a death ruse isn’t easy. The performers are constantly 
gauging their surroundings for cues on when it’s safe to rise. Chickens, for instance, can sense
when a predator’s eyes are upon them. Researchers know this because when they
used a stuffed hawk in an experiment, their chicken subjects came out of their
catatonia quicker when the hawk’s eyes were averted. Other animals use TI for purposes 
other than defense. When the sleeper cichlid feels peckish, it sinks to the lake floor 
and lies motionless, its splotchy coloration making it 
seem like a rotting carcass. If a small scavenger investigates, 
this undead trickster strikes. Some animals even feign death 
as a sexual ploy. Male nursery spiders offer gifts of
silk-wrapped insects in hopes of wooing females. But those females are known 
to eat love-seeking males. By playing dead while the female 
eagerly devours her snack, these males can cautiously revive and improve their chances 
of successfully mating. So TI can work to an animal’s advantage,
unless someone else knows its secret. California orcas can flip over 
young great white sharks, inducing TI for so long 
the immobilized sharks, who must move to respire, 
essentially suffocate. Humans can also flip sharks into TI. By stroking a shark’s 
electrically-sensitive snout and gently turning it over, researchers can induce TI 
that lasts up to 15 minutes. That’s enough time to insert tags, remove hooks, and even perform surgeries. There are risks however: TI can hamper respiration and induce
hyperglycemia, a sign of stress. So this technique should only 
be used when necessary. Humans can also experience TI when they
freeze with fear during violent assaults. Recognizing this ancient, involuntary
form of self-defense has significant implications 
when trying to understand why some victims don’t flee 
or fight in the face of danger. So, studying TI in non-human animals not only helps us better understand some
odd behaviors, it can also help us better 
understand our own, sometimes counterintuitive, responses to violence.","Animals play dead as a survival tactic, a behavior called thanatosis or tonic immobility (TI). This can involve odd postures, stench, and even sacrificing neighbors. The parasympathetic nervous system and dopamine play a role in TI. Animals gauge their surroundings to determine when it's safe to resurrect. TI can also be used for sexual ploys or as a defense mechanism against predators. For example, orcas can induce TI in young great white sharks, causing them to suffocate. Humans can also induce TI in sharks for research purposes, but this should only be done when necessary due to potential risks. Recognizing TI in humans can help us understand why some victims don't flee or fight during violent assaults.

3,3,uSTNyHkde08,Why isn't the world covered in poop? - Eleanor Slade and Paul Manning,"Somewhere near you, 
an animal is defecating. In fact, each day, the animal kingdom 
produces roughly enough dung to match the volume of water pouring 
over the Victoria Falls. So why isn’t the planet covered 
in the stuff? You can thank the humble dung beetle 
for eating up the excess. Capable of burying 250 times 
their body weight in a single night, these valiant insects make
quick work of an endless stream of feces. Over 7,000 known species of dung beetle 
run clean-up duty across six continents —everywhere except Antarctica. A dung beetle’s first task 
is to locate dung. Some live on the anal regions 
of larger animals, ready to leap off when they defecate. Others sniff out feces 
that animals leave behind. A pile of elephant dung can attract 
4,000 beetles in 15 minutes. So once a beetle finds dung, it must work quickly to secure 
some of the bounty for itself. Most dung beetle species fall into one 
of three main groups: rollers, tunnelers, and dwellers. Dung rollers sculpt a ball of dung,
and using their back legs, quickly roll it away from competitors. Potential partners jump on the ball, and once the ball-maker 
has selected their mate, the pair dig their dung ball 
into the soil. Once it’s been buried, the female lays 
a single egg within the dung ball. Tunnelers have a different approach. Digging underneath a pat, 
some drag dung down into the soil and pack it into clumps 
known as brood balls, dung balls, or dung “sausages,” 
depending on their shape and size. Male tunnelers sport a spectacular 
array of horns to fight each other
for control of these tunnels, which they then defend 
until the female’s laid her egg. Some male tunnelers avoid the fray
by masquerading as hornless females and sneaking into tunnels to mate 
while the guardians’ heads are turned. The third group of dung beetles, dwellers, take the most straightforward approach, laying their eggs
directly into a dung pat. This makes their offspring
more vulnerable to predation than those of the tunnelers and rollers. As the larvae feed, they riddle 
the dung pat with tunnels, leaving remains that are quickly colonized
by bacteria and fungi and weathered away. Inside a tunnel, ball, or pat, 
once the larvae hatch, they consume the dung 
before metamorphosing into a pupa and then an adult beetle. Besides clearing dung, 
the actions of these beetles have considerable ecological importance. For one, they serve as secondary 
seed dispersers. Dung from monkeys, wild pigs, and other animals is riddled with seeds 
from the fruits they eat. When beetles bury their dung balls, they inadvertently protect these seeds 
from predators and increase the likelihood 
they’ll germinate. The advantage is so great 
that one South African plant has evolved to produce seeds that look 
and smell like dung to trick beetles into burying them. Dung beetles also play important roles 
in agricultural systems. Livestock, like cows and sheep,
produce huge amounts of dung, which contains nutrients 
that can benefit plants. The beetles break up the dung 
and tunnel it deep into the soil, bringing the nutrients into close contact
with plant roots. Their services to farmers have been valued
at $380 million a year in the US and £367 million a year in the UK. Dung beetles can even help us battle 
global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions
associated with farming. Microbes living in oxygen-poor 
livestock dung produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas. But beetles oxygenate pats when 
they tunnel into them, preventing the microbes
from producing methane. The dung beetle spreads seeds, helps farmers, and fights climate change —and accomplishes it all
simply by doing its business. Maybe next time you come across 
some dung in the forest or a field, you’ll be tempted to take a closer look.","The world isn't covered in poop because of the hard work of dung beetles. These insects, found on six continents, consume and bury animal waste, preventing the planet from being overwhelmed by dung. Dung beetles fall into three categories: rollers, tunnelers, and dwellers. Rollers create dung balls and roll them away, tunnelers dig tunnels and pack dung into brood balls, and dwellers lay their eggs directly in dung pats. Dung beetles have a significant ecological impact, such as dispersing seeds, benefiting agricultural systems, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. So, the next time you see dung, take a closer look and appreciate the diligent dung beetles!

4,4,-64U7WoBrqM,Why are sloths so slow? - Kenny Coogan,"In 1796, Thomas Jefferson received
a box of bones he couldn't identify. A long, sharp claw reminded him of a lion, but the arm bones 
suggested a larger animal, one about three meters long. Thinking it might be huge unknown
species of North American lion, Jefferson warned explorers Lewis and Clark to keep an eye out 
for this mysterious predator. But Jefferson's box of bones didn't
come from a lion. They came from an extinct giant sloth. Prehistoric ground sloths first appeared
around 35 million years ago. Dozens of species lived across
North, Central and South America, alongside other ancient creatures
like mastodons and giant armadillos. Some ground sloths, like the megalonychid,
were cat-sized, but many were massive. Jefferson's sloth, Megalonyx,
weighed about a ton, and that was small 
compared to megatherium, which could reach six metric tons,
as much as an elephant. They ambled through the forests
and savannas using their strong arms and sharp claws to uproot plants and climb trees, grazing on grasses, leaves,
and prehistoric avocados. In fact, we might not have avocados
today if not for the giant sloths. Smaller animals couldn't swallow
the avocado's huge seed, but the sloths could, and they spread avocado trees
far and wide. Ground sloths flourished for millions
of years, but around 10,000 years ago,
they started disappearing along with the Western Hemisphere's
other giant mammals. Researchers think that ground sloths
could have been pushed out by an oncoming ice age, or competition with other species,
maybe humans, who arrived in the region around the time
most of the sloths went extinct. Some of the smaller sloths did survive
and migrated to the treetops. Today, there are six species left
living in the rainforest canopies of Central and South America. Hanging out in the trees is a good way
to avoid predators, and there are plenty of leaves to eat. But this diet has its drawbacks. Animals extract energy from food
and use that energy to move around, maintain their body temperature, keep their organs working, and all the other activities necessary
for survival. But leaves don't contain much energy, and that which they do have
is tough to extract. Most herbivores supplement a leafy diet
with higher energy foods like fruit and seeds. But sloths, especially three-toed sloths,
rely on leaves almost exclusively. They've evolved finely tuned strategies
for coping with this restricted diet. First, they extract as much energy from
their food as possible. Sloths have a multi-chambered stomach
that takes up a third of their body, and depending on the species, they can spend five to seven days,
or even weeks, processing a meal. The other piece of the puzzle
is to use as little energy as possible. One way sloths do this is, of course,
by not moving very much. They spend most of their time eating,
resting, or sleeping. They descend from the canopy just once
a week for a bathroom break. When sloths do move, it's not very fast. It would take a sloth about five minutes
to cross an average neighborhood street. This unhurried approach to life means
that sloths don't need very much muscle. In fact, they have about 30% less
muscle mass than other animals their size. Sloths also use less energy 
to keep themselves warm because their body temperature
can fluctuate by about five degrees Celsius, less than a cold-blooded reptile,
but more than most mammals. These physical and behavioral adaptations 
minimize the sloth's energy expenditure, or metabolic rate. Three-toed sloths have the slowest 
metabolism of any mammal. The giant panda is second slowest, and two-toed sloths come in third. Moving slowly has allowed sloths
to thrive in their treetop habitat. But it's also made the sloths themselves
a great habitat for other organisms, including algae, which provides a little
extra camouflage, and maybe even a snack. Sloths may not be giant anymore, but that doesn't make 
them any less remarkable.","Sloths are slow because they have evolved to extract as much energy as possible from their leafy diet and use as little energy as possible.

5,5,vcPJkz-D5II,The evolution of animal genitalia - Menno Schilthuizen,"The evolutionary tango 
of animal genitalia. Can you guess what you're looking at? If you answered ""duck vagina,""
you'd be right. Although the bird's outward appearance
may not strike you as especially odd, it uses this strange, intricate, cork-screw shaped contraption 
to reproduce. We see similarly unbelievable genitalia
in insects, mammals, reptiles, fish, spiders, and even snails. Apparently, no organs evolve
faster and into more variable shapes than those involved in procreation. Superficially, it makes sense
because evolution works via reproduction. When an animal leaves more offspring,
its genes will spread. And since genitalia are an animal's tools
for reproduction, any improvement there 
will have immediate effect. And yet, what's the point of having
such decorative nether regions? After all, the function 
of genitalia seems simple. A penis deposits a bit of sperm and a vagina receives it 
and delivers it to the egg. A pipette-like thingy on the male and a funnel-like gizmo on the female
should do just fine for any animal. And yet, that's not what we see. The penis of a chicken flea, for example,
looks nothing like a pipette, more like an exploded grandfather clock. And the vagina of a featherwing beetle resembles something you'd find
in a Dr. Seuss book. Throughout the animal kingdom, genitalia are very complex things, much more complicated than seems
necessary for what they're meant to do. That's because genitalia do more than just
deposit and receive sperm. Many male animals also use the penis
as courtship device, like crane flies. In some South American species, males have a tiny washboard and scraper
on their penis, which produces a song that reverberates
throughout the female's body when they mate. It's thought that if female crane flies
enjoy this unusual serenade, they'll allow the male 
to father their offspring. This way, the genes of the most
musical penises spread, leading to rapid evolution
of insects' phalluses. Similarly, some beetles have two little
drumsticks on either side of the penis. During mating, they'll rub, slap, or tap
the female with these. And some hoofed mammals,
like rams and bulls, use a whip-like extension 
on the penis's left side to create a sensation during mating. But how can females really choose
between males if she can only assess them after mating? This is where the power
of female adaptation comes into play. In fact, insemination is different
to conception, and the female genitalia exploit
this distinction. For instance, in some dung flies, the vagina contains pockets
for separating sperm from different males depending on how appealing they were. Males using their penises for courtship and females controlling 
their own sperm management are two reasons why genitalia evolve
into such complex shapes. But there are others because genitalia are also where
a sexual conflict is played out. A female's interests are best served if
she fertilizes her eggs with the sperm of the best fathers and creates genetic variability amongst
her offspring. For a male, on the other hand,
this is bad news. For him, it would be best if a female
used his sperm to fertilize all of her eggs. So we see cycles of adaptation
in an evolutionary arms race to retain control. Black widow spiders 
have a disposable penis tip that breaks off inside the vagina
blocking the attempts of his rivals, and bed bug males bypass a female's
genitalia altogether using a syringe-like penis to inject
sperm cells directly into her belly. Not to be outdone, females have evolved 
their own countermeasures. In some bed bug species, the females have evolved an entirely
new set of genitalia on their right hand flanks
where the males usually pierce them. That allows them to maintain
the power to filter out unwanted sperm with their genitalia. And duck vaginas are shaped
like a clockwise spiral so that when the male inflates his long,
counterclockwise coiled penis into her, and she disapproves, all she needs to do 
is flex her vaginal muscles and the penis just flubs out. So, genitalia differs so much,
not just to fascinate us, but because in every species, they're the result of 
a furious evolutionary tango of sex that has been going on
for millions of years and will continue for millions 
of years to come.","Animal genitalia are incredibly diverse and evolve faster than other body parts. This is because they play a crucial role in reproduction, and any improvement there has immediate effects. However, genitalia do more than just deposit and receive sperm. Many male animals use their penises as courtship devices, while females have evolved ways to manage sperm. This leads to an evolutionary arms race, with males and females constantly adapting to retain control. For example, black widow spiders have a disposable penis tip, while bed bug females have evolved new genitalia to filter out unwanted sperm. Duck vaginas are shaped like a clockwise spiral, making it difficult for males to penetrate them if they are not approved. Overall, animal genitalia are the result of a furious evolutionary tango of sex that has been going on for millions of years."
6,6,IxndOd3kmSs,"Meet the tardigrade, the toughest animal on Earth - Thomas Boothby","Without water, a human can only
survive for about 100 hours. But there's a creature so resilient
that it can go without it for decades. This one millimeter animal can survive
both the hottest and coldest environments on Earth, and can even withstand high levels
of radiation. This is the tardigrade, and it's one of the toughest creatures
on Earth, even if it does look more like
a chubby, eight-legged gummy bear. Most organisms need water to survive. Water allows metabolism to occur, which is the process that drives
all the biochemical reactions that take place in cells. But creatures like the tardigrade,
also known as the water bear, get around this restriction
with a process called anhydrobiosis, from the Greek meaning
life without water. And however extraordinary,
tardigrades aren't alone. Bacteria, single-celled organisms called archaea, plants, and even other animals 
can all survive drying up. For many tardigrades, this requires that they go through 
something called a tun state. They curl up into a ball, pulling their head and eight legs
inside their body and wait until water returns. It's thought that as water
becomes scarce and tardigrades enter their tun state, they start synthesize special molecules, which fill the tardigrade's cells
to replace lost water by forming a matrix. Components of the cells that are
sensitive to dryness, like DNA, proteins, and membranes, get trapped in this matrix. It's thought that this keeps these
molecules locked in position to stop them from unfolding, breaking apart, or fusing together. Once the organism is rehydrated,
the matrix dissolves, leaving behind undamaged, 
functional cells. Beyond dryness, tardigrades can also
tolerate other extreme stresses: being frozen, heated up past the boiling point
of water, high levels of radiation, and even the vacuum of outer space. This has led to some erroneous speculation that tardigrades 
are extraterrestrial beings. While that's fun to think about, scientific evidence places their
origin firmly on Earth where they've evolved over time. In fact, this earthly evolution 
has given rise to over 1100 known species of tardigrades and there are probably many others
yet to be discovered. And because tardigrades are so hardy,
they exist just about everywhere. They live on every continent,
including Antarctica. And they're in diverse biomes
including deserts, ice sheets, the sea, fresh water, rainforests, and the highest mountain peaks. But you can find tardigrades
in the most ordinary places, too, like moss or lichen found in yards, parks, and forests. All you need to find them is a little
patience and a microscope. Scientists are now to trying to find out
whether tardigrades use the tun state, their anti-drying technique, to survive other stresses. If we can understand how they,
and other creatures, stabilize their sensitive 
biological molecules, perhaps we could apply this knowledge
to help us stabilize vaccines, or to develop stress-tolerant crops that 
can cope with Earth's changing climate. And by studying how tardigrades survive prolonged exposure 
to the vacuum of outer space, scientists can generate clues about
the environmental limits of life and how to safeguard astronauts. In the process, tardigrades could even
help us answer a critical question: could life survive on planets much
less hospitable than our own?","Tardigrades, also known as water bears, are tiny creatures that can survive extreme conditions, such as drought, freezing, and radiation. They can do this by entering a state called anhydrobiosis, where they curl up into a ball and synthesize special molecules that protect their cells. Tardigrades can be found all over the world, even in the most ordinary places like moss or lichen. Scientists are studying tardigrades to learn how to stabilize vaccines, develop stress-tolerant crops, and safeguard astronauts. They are also studying how tardigrades survive in outer space to understand the environmental limits of life and the possibility of life on other planets."
7,7,VgEbcQxFUu8,Why do we harvest horseshoe crab blood? - Elizabeth Cox,"During the warmer months,
especially at night during the full moon, horseshoe crabs emerge 
from the sea to spawn. Waiting for them are teams
of lab workers who capture the horseshoe crabs
by the hundreds of thousands, take them to labs, harvest their cerulean blood, then return them to the sea. Oddly enough, we capture horseshoe crabs
on the beach because that's the only place
we know we can find them. A female horseshoe crab lays as many
as 20 batches of up to 4,000 eggs on her annual visit to the beach. When the eggs hatch, the juvenile horseshoe crabs
often stay near shore, periodically shedding their shells
as they grow. Once they leave 
these shallow waters, they don't return until they
reach sexual maturity ten years later. Despite our best efforts, we don't
know where they spend those years. Though we've spotted the occasional 
horseshoe crab as deep as 200 meters below
the ocean's surface, we only see large groups of adults
when they come ashore to spawn. Horseshoe crab blood contains
cells called amebocytes that protect them 
from infection by viruses, fungi, and bacteria. Amebocytes form gels around
these invaders to prevent them from spreading infections. This isn't unusual. All animals have protective 
immune systems. But horseshoe crab amebocytes
are exceptionally sensitive to bacterial endotoxins. Endotoxins are molecules
from the cell walls of certain bacteria, including E. coli. Large amounts of them are released
when bacterial cells die, and they can make us sick
if they enter the blood stream. Many of the medicines and medical devices
we rely on can become contaminated, so we have to test them
before they touch our blood. We do have tests called Gram stains
that detect bacteria, but they can't recognize endotoxins which can be there even when
bacteria aren't present. So scientists use an extract called LAL produced from harvested 
horseshoe crab blood to test for endotoxins. They add LAL to a medicine sample,
and if gels form, bacterial endotoxins are present. Today, the LAL test is used so widely that millions of people who've
never seen a horseshoe crab have been protected by their blood. If you've ever had an injection,
that probably includes you. How did horseshoe crabs end up
with such special blood? Like other invertebrates, the horseshoe crab has an open
circulatory system. This means their blood isn't contained
in blood vessels, like ours. Instead, horseshoe crab blood
flows freely through the body cavity and comes in direct contact with tissues. If bacteria enters their blood,
it can quickly spread over a large area. Pair this vulnerability with the horseshoe crab's bacteria-filled 
ocean and shoreline habitats, and it's easy to see why they need
such a sensitive immune response. Horseshoe crabs survived 
mass extinction events that wiped out over 90% of life on Earth
and killed off the dinosaurs, but they're not invincible. And the biggest disruptions they've faced
in millions of years come from us. Studies have shown that up to
15% of horseshoe crabs die in the process of having
their blood harvested. And recent research suggests
this number may be even higher. Researchers have also observed
fewer females returning to spawn at some of the most harvested areas. Our impact on horseshoe crabs extends
beyond the biomedical industry, too. Coastal development 
destroys spawning sites, and horseshoe crabs are also
killed for fishing bait. There's ample evidence that
their populations are shrinking. Some researchers have started working to synthesize horseshoe crab 
blood in the lab. For now, we're unlikely to stop
our beach trips, but hopefully, a synthetic alternative
will someday eliminate our reliance on the blood of these ancient creatures.","Horseshoe crabs are fascinating creatures that have been around for millions of years.

8,8,r5_ZSnFDPRg,The surprising reason birds sing - Partha P. Mitra,"This is a song sung by a brown thrasher. But that’s just one of the thousand 
or more that it knows, and it’s not the only avian virtuoso. A wood thrush can sing 
two pitches at once. A mockingbird can match the sounds 
around it, including car alarms. And the Australian superb lyrebird has an incredible, elaborate song 
and dance ritual. These are just a few of 
the 4,000 species of songbirds. Most birds produce short, simple calls, but songbirds also have 
a repertoire of complex vocal patterns that help them attract mates, defend territory, and strengthen their social bonds. Each songbird species 
has its own distinct song patterns, some with characteristic 
regional dialects. Experienced listeners can even distinguish
individual birds by their unique songs. So how do birds learn these songs 
in the first place? How do they know to mimic the songs 
of their own species? Are they born knowing how to sing? A lot of what scientists know about bird
song comes from studying zebra finches. A baby male zebra finch typically learns 
to sing from its father or other males, starting while it’s still 
a fledgling in the nest. First comes a sensory learning phase, when the baby finch hears the songs
sung around it and commits them to memory. The bird starts to vocalize 
during the motor learning phase, practicing until it can 
match the song it memorized. As the bird learns, hearing 
the tutor’s song over and over again is helpful—
up to a point. If he hears it too many times, the
imitation degrades— and the source matters. If the song is played 
through a loudspeaker, he can’t pick it up as easily. But hide the same loudspeaker inside 
a toy painted to look like a zebra finch, and his learning improves. What if the baby never hears another 
zebra finch’s song? Interestingly enough, it’ll sing anyway. Isolated finches still produce 
what are called innate or isolate songs. A specific tune might be taught, but the instinct to sing seems
to be hardwired into a songbird’s brain. Innate songs sound different from
the “cultured” songs learned from other finches—at first. If isolated zebra finches 
start a new colony, the young birds pick up 
the isolate song from their parents. But the song changes 
from generation to generation. And after a few iterations, the melody actually starts to resemble the cultured songs sung 
by zebra finches in the wild. Something about the learning process 
must be hardwired, too, drawing the birds towards the
same song patterns again and again. This means that basic information 
about the zebra finch song must be stored somewhere 
in its genome, imprinted there by millions 
of years of evolution. At first, this might seem odd, as we usually think of genetic code as a
source of biochemical or physical traits, not something like a behavior or action. But the two aren’t 
fundamentally different; we can connect genomes to
behavior through brain circuitry. The connection is noisy and quite complex. It doesn’t simply map single genes 
to single behaviors, but it exists. Genomes contain codes for proteins 
that guide brain development, such as molecules that guide the pathways
of developing axons, shaping distinct circuits. Birds’ brains 
have so-called “song circuits” that are active when the birds sing. These circuits also respond to the song 
of a bird’s own species more strongly than
to other species’ songs. So the theory is that a bird’s genes 
guide development of brain circuits that relate to singing 
and the ability to learn songs. Then, exposure to songs 
shapes those neural circuits to produce the songs 
that are typical to that species. Genetically encoded or innate behaviors 
aren’t unique to songbirds. They’re widespread in the animal kingdom. Spectacular examples include the long-distance migrations 
of monarch butterflies and salmon. So what does this mean for humans? Are we also born with innate 
information written into our genomes that helps shape our neural circuits, and ultimately results 
in something we know? Could there be some knowledge that is unique 
and intrinsic to humans as a species?","Birds sing to attract mates, defend territory, and strengthen social bonds.

9,9,rcAN4rkTmNU,The life cycle of the butterfly - Franziska Bauer,"In order to become a butterfly, a caterpillar’s body dissolves 
almost completely and is rebuilt from its own juices. As inconvenient and even downright 
dangerous as this process sounds, it’s actually quite common. Butterflies are just a few of 
the 800,000 insect species that transition from larvae to adults 
through complete metamorphosis. That’s approximately 85% of insects 
and 70% of all known animal species. But how exactly does 
a caterpillar become a butterfly? When a caterpillar hatches 
from an egg, it has none of a butterfly’s 
physical traits. It does have groups of cells
inside its body called imaginal discs that will eventually 
become its butterfly parts. For now, these cells remain dormant. Juvenile hormone suppresses 
their activity, and prevents the caterpillar
from beginning metamorphosis too early. Immediately after hatching,
the caterpillar begins to feed, building up fat until its rigid skin,
called a cuticle, becomes too tight. At this point, a hormone called ecdysone 
triggers the cuticle to shed, or molt. As the caterpillar grows, 
it usually molts four times. Then, when it’s nice and plump, the caterpillar’s levels 
of juvenile hormone drop, which triggers it to stop
eating and moving. A final burst of ecdysone prompts the caterpillar’s cells 
to begin to self-destruct. Soon, the muscles, fat, and other tissues 
are almost entirely liquefied, though the imaginal discs stay intact
and begin to grow. At the same time, a second skin layer 
called the pupal cuticle forms underneath the first. One more molt exposes 
the hard exterior of the pupa. Besides the imaginal discs, 
only a few tissues are spared, including parts of the respiratory system, the heart, some abdominal muscles, and the mushroom bodies of the brain. The caterpillar juice then fuels 
the development of the imaginal discs into eyes, antennae, legs, wings, genitalia, and other body parts. Once its new body is built, 
the insect molts one last time, shedding the pupal cuticle. From there, it’s free to fly away 
a new butterfly. Even after such a dramatic transformation, the butterfly does retain some memories 
from its caterpillar days. It’s likely the mushroom bodies 
of the brain carry important knowledge from the
caterpillar over to the adult butterfly. How did such an involved developmental 
process come to be? We don’t know for sure. The leading theory is that the caterpillar
is actually a drawn-out version of a life stage that takes place 
inside the egg for some other insects. According to this hypothesis,
over millions of years, the larvae evolved the ability
to eat and live outside the egg. Regardless of how complete 
metamorphosis originated, it’s become part of the life cycles of
a dizzying number of insect species. Still, plenty of species get along 
perfectly well with a simpler developmental process. What survival advantages might 
complete metamorphosis provide to make up for the added hassle? For one, it keeps larvae and adults from competing for the same habitats
and food sources. And while the pupa may seem vulnerable, this immobile stage 
can actually be a good way to pass parts of the year 
when food is scarce. To us, a butterfly’s metamorphosis 
might sound as fantastic as a phoenix rising from its ashes. But these transformations are taking place
all around us, all the time. From the Hercules beetle to the honey bee to the garden ant, countless squishy larvae dissolve 
and emerge as armored, aerodynamic, 
and nimble adults.","Butterflies are one of the 800,000 insect species that undergo complete metamorphosis, which is when a caterpillar's body dissolves almost completely and rebuilds itself from its own juices.

10,10,bVMVxJJ7P8M,Cannibalism in the animal kingdom - Bill Schutt,"In the deserts of the American Southwest, spadefoot toad tadpoles 
hatch in tiny oases. Until they develop into toadlets, 
they can’t survive outside of water, but these ponds are transient 
and quickly evaporate. The tadpoles are 
in a race against the clock to grow up before 
their nurseries disappear. So nearly overnight,
some of the brood explode in size. They use their jack-o-lantern teeth 
and huge jaw muscles to devour their smaller pond mates. Nourished by this extra fuel, they develop quicker, 
leaving the pond before it can dry out. The spadefoot toad 
is far from the only animal to eat members of its own species 
as a normal part of its life cycle. All of these animals do. If that surprises you, 
you’re in good company. Until recently, scientists 
thought cannibalism was a rare response to starvation 
or other extreme stress. Well-known cannibals, like the praying mantis
and black widow spider, were considered bizarre exceptions. But now, we know they more 
or less represent the rule. While it may seem counterproductive for members of the same species 
to eat each other, cannibalism can promote the survival 
of the species as a whole by reducing competition, culling the weak, and bolstering the strong. Some species, like the spadefoot toad, cannibalize in response 
to environmental pressures. Their situation is precarious, but cannibalism for them isn’t 
a last-ditch attempt to avoid starvation. Rather, it’s a way to more quickly 
outgrow a stage where they’re especially vulnerable 
to predation or dangerous environmental conditions. Other species, including many fish, indiscriminately cannibalize each other 
during foraging behavior. Fish produce large numbers of tiny young, and adults exhibit about as much 
individual recognition of their offspring as humans do for a handful of raisins. Fish eggs, larvae, and juveniles 
are easily available, nutrient-rich meals, and with thousands of eggs in a clutch, plenty are still available to hatch 
after the adults have snacked. Baby fish aren’t just at risk of being 
cannibalized by adults— siblings eat each other too. Sand tiger shark eggs develop and hatch inside their mother’s oviducts 
at different times. When the hatchlings run out of yolk 
from their own eggs, they eat the other eggs and hatchlings until one baby shark
from each oviduct remains. When they emerge, the young sharks 
are well-nourished, experienced predators who stand a better chance of surviving. Even when they aren’t consumed 
for nutrition, young animals are especially 
vulnerable to cannibalism. Hamsters, rats, and other rodent mothers will eat some of their young
if they’re sick, dead, or simply too numerous to feed. In other mammals, 
including bears and lions, males will kill offspring 
sired by another. That’s because childless females become 
receptive to mating more quickly than if they were caring for a cub. Rather than waste nutritious meat,
the males then eat the dead cubs. Meanwhile, cannibalism is less common 
in birds than in other groups, but certain species will eat diseased
or dead hatchlings as a way of disposing of the
bodies before they can attract maggots. When adults eat each other, males are
cannibalized more often than females, usually during mating 
and generally because they’re smaller. Male Australian redback spiders
mate with much larger females. Rather than scrambling away after mating, 
the tiny male does a somersault, bringing his abdomen into contact 
with his mate’s mouthparts. The female showers him with enzyme-rich 
gut juice and consumes his abdomen. Males not killed in the initial mating 
crawl back into the fray, often half-eaten, to mate again, after which they’re 
dispatched to the spider pantry. So not only does the male provide 
the female with his sperm, but he also provides her with 
a nutritious meal to better ensure that she’ll
survive to pass on his genes. All in all, it’s clear 
that cannibalism is as much a part of life 
in the animal kingdom as other, better-recognized behaviors. As we sink our teeth into the evidence 
of cannibalism in nature, we might ask ourselves, what else have we missed by applying
human standards to the natural world?","Cannibalism is common in the animal kingdom. Spadefoot toad tadpoles eat each other to grow faster and escape the pond before it dries out. Fish, sharks, and rodents also eat their own kind. Baby fish are at risk of being eaten by adults and siblings. Mammals eat their young if they're sick, dead, or too numerous. Birds eat diseased or dead hatchlings to dispose of the bodies. Male Australian redback spiders mate with larger females and then become a meal for them. Cannibalism ensures the survival of the species by reducing competition, culling the weak, and bolstering the strong. It's a natural behavior that has been misunderstood for a long time."
11,11,BvLolPN8NvU,A simple way to tell insects apart - Anika Hazra,"A whip-like straw. Powerful, crushing blades. A pointed, piercing tube. There are nearly a million 
known insect species in the world, but most have one of just 
five common types of mouthparts. And that’s extremely useful to scientists because when they encounter 
an unfamiliar insect in the wild, they can learn a lot about it 
just by examining how it eats. Scientific classification, or taxonomy, is used to organize all 
living things into seven levels: kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. The features of an insect’s mouthparts can
help identify which order it belongs to, while also providing clues about how 
it evolved and what it feeds on. The chewing mouthpart is the most common. It’s also the most primitive— all other mouthparts are thought to have 
started out looking like this one before evolving into something different. It features a pair 
of jaws called mandibles with toothed inner edges that cut up 
and crush solid foods, like leaves or other insects. You can find this mouthpart 
on ants from the Hymenoptera order, grasshoppers and crickets 
of the Orthoptera order, dragonflies of the Odonata order, and beetles of the Coleoptera order. The piercing-sucking mouthpart consists of
a long, tube-like structure called a beak. This beak can pierce plant 
or animal tissue to suck up liquids like sap or blood. It can also secrete saliva 
with digestive enzymes that liquefy food for easier sucking. Insects in the Hemiptera order 
have piercing-sucking mouthparts and include bed bugs, cicadas, aphids, and leafhoppers. The siphoning mouthpart, a friendlier version 
of the piercing and sucking beak, also consists of a long, tube-like 
structure called a proboscis that works like a straw 
to suck up nectar from flowers. Insects of the Lepidoptera order— butterflies and moths— keep their proboscises rolled
up tightly beneath their heads when they’re not feeding and unfurl them when 
they come across some sweet nectar. With the sponging mouthpart,
there’s yet another tube, this time ending in two spongy lobes that contain many finer 
tubes called pseudotracheae. The pseudotracheae secrete 
enzyme-filled saliva and soak up fluids 
and dissolved foods by capillary action. House flies, fruit flies, and the other non-biting 
members of the Diptera order are the only insects 
that use this technique. But, there’s a catch. Biting flies within Diptera, like mosquitoes, horse flies, and deer flies, have a piercing-sucking mouthpart 
instead of the sponging mouthpart. And finally, the chewing-lapping mouthpart
is a combination of mandibles and a proboscis with a tongue-like 
structure at its tip for lapping up nectar. On this type of mouthpart, the mandibles themselves 
are not actually used for eating. For bees and wasps,
members of the Hymenoptera order, they serve instead as tools 
for pollen-collecting and wax-molding. Of course, in nature, there are always 
exceptions to the rules. The juvenile stages of some insects, 
for example, have completely different kinds 
of mouths than their adult versions, like caterpillars, which use chewing 
mouthparts to devour leaves before metamorphosing into
butterflies and moths with siphoning mouthparts. Still, mouthpart identification can, 
for the most part, help scientists—and you
—categorize insects. So why not break out a magnifying lens and learn a little more about
who’s nibbling your vegetable garden, biting your arm, or just flying by your ear.","There are nearly a million known insect species, but most have one of just five common types of mouthparts.

12,12,y6u1GPpJuR4,Why do animals form swarms? - Maria R. D'Orsogna,"When desert locusts are well fed,
they're solitary creatures. But when food becomes scarce, hungry, desperate locusts
crowd onto small patches of land where they can still find 
something to eat. Contact between different locusts'
hind legs set off a slew of reactions that change their appearance and behavior. Now, instead of shunning their peers,
they seek each other out. The locusts eventually start marching
and then fly away in large numbers seeking a better habitat. These gigantic swarms can host
millions of insects and travel thousands of miles, devastating vegetation and crops. They stay close to each other,
but not too close, or they might get eaten
by their hungry neighbors. When many individual organisms, like locusts, bacteria, anchovies, or bats, come together and move 
as one coordinated entity, that's a swarm. From a handful of birds 
to billions of insects, swarms can be almost any size. But what they have in common
is that there's no leader. Members of the swarm interact
only with their nearest neighbors or through indirect cues. Each individual follows simple rules: Travel in the same direction 
as those around you, stay close, and avoid collisions. There are many benefits to traveling
in a group like this. Small prey may fool predators
by assembling into a swarm that looks like a much bigger organism. And congregating in a large group reduces the chance that any single 
individual will be captured. Moving in the same direction
as your neighbors saves energy by sharing the effort
of fighting wind or water resistance. It may even be easier 
to find a mate in a swarm. Swarming can also allow groups of animals to accomplish tasks 
they couldn’t do individually. When hundreds or millions or organisms
follow the same simple rules, sophisticated behavior called
swarm intelligence may arise. A single ant can't do much on its own, but an ant colony 
can solve complex problems, like building a nest and finding the shortest path
to a food source. But sometimes, things can go wrong. In a crowd, diseases spread more easily, and some swarming organisms may start
eating each other if food is scarce. Even some of the benefits of swarms,
like more efficient navigation, can have catastrophic consequences. Army ants are one example. They lay down chemicals called pheromones which signal their neighbors 
to follow the trail. This is good if the head of the group
is marching towards a food source. But occasionally the ants in the front
can veer off course. The whole swarm can get caught
in a loop following the pheromone trail until they die of exhaustion. Humans are notoriously individualistic,
though social, animals. But is there anything we can learn
from collective swarm-based organization? When it comes to technology,
the answer is definitely yes. Bats can teach drones how to navigate
confined spaces without colliding, fish can help design software
for safer driving, and insects are inspiring robot teams that
can assist search and rescue missions. For swarms of humans, 
it's perhaps more complicated and depends on the motives and leadership. Swarm behavior in human populations can
sometimes manifest as a destructive mob. But collective action can also produce
a crowd-sourced scientific breakthrough and artistic expression, or a peaceful global revolution.","Animals form swarms when food is scarce, such as desert locusts.

13,13,Hja0SLs2kus,The amazing ways plants defend themselves - Valentin Hammoudi,"This is a tomato plant, and this is an aphid slowly killing
the tomato plant by sucking the juice out of its leaves. The tomato is putting up a fight
using both physical and chemical defenses to repel the attacking insects. But that's not all. The tomato is also releasing compounds
that signal nearby tomato plants to release their own insect repellent. Plants are constantly under attack. They face threats ranging from 
microscopic fungi and bacteria, small herbivores, like aphids,
caterpillars, and grasshoppers, up to large herbivores, like tortoises,
koalas, and elephants. All are looking to devour plants
to access the plentiful nutrients and water in their leaves, stems,
fruits, and seeds. But plants are ready with a whole
series of internal and external defenses that make them a much less 
appealing meal, or even a deadly one. Plants' defenses start at their surface. The bark covering tree trunks is full
of lignin, a rigid web of compounds that's
tough to chew and highly impermeable to pathogens. Leaves are protected by
a waxy cuticle that deters insects and microbes. Some plants go a step further
with painful structures to warn would-be predators. Thorns, spines, and prickles
discourage bigger herbivores. To deal with smaller pests, some plants'
leaves have sharp hair-like structures called trichomes. The kidney bean plant sports tiny
hooks to stab the feet of bed bugs and other insects. In some species, trichomes also dispense
chemical irritants. Stinging nettles release a mixture
of histamine and other toxins that cause pain and inflammation
when touched. For other plant species, the pain comes
after an herbivore's first bite. Spinach, kiwi fruit, pineapple, fuchsia and rhubarb all produce microscopic
needle-shaped crystals called raphides. They can cause tiny wounds in the inside
of animals' mouths, which create entry points for toxins. The mimosa plant has a strategy
designed to prevent herbivores from taking a bite at all. Specialized mechanoreceptor cells
detect touch and shoot an electrical signal
through the leaflet to its base causing cells there to release
charged particles. The buildup of charge draws
water out of these cells and they shrivel, 
pulling the leaflet closed. The folding movement scares insects away and the shrunken leaves look less
appealing to larger animals. If these external defenses are breached, the plant immune system 
springs into action. Plants don't have a separate immune system
like animals. Instead, every cell has the ability
to detect and defend against invaders. Specialized receptors can recognize 
molecules that signal the presence of dangerous microbes or insects. In response, the immune system initiates 
a battery of defensive maneuvers. To prevent more pathogens from making
their way inside, the waxy cuticle thickens and cell walls
get stronger. Guard cells seal up pores in the leaves. And if microbes are devouring one section
of the plant, those cells can self-destruct 
to quarantine the infection. Compounds toxic to microbes and insects
are also produced, often tailor-made for a specific threat. Many of the plant molecules that humans
have adopted as drugs, medicines and seasonings evolved as part of plants' immune systems
because they're antimicrobial, or insecticidal. An area of a plant under attack can alert
other regions using hormones, airborne compounds, or even electrical signals. When other parts of the plant detect
these signals, they ramp up production
of defensive compounds. And for some species, like tomatoes, this early warning system also
alerts their neighbors. Some plants can even recruit
allies to adopt a strong offense against their would-be attackers. Cotton plants under siege by caterpillars release a specific cocktail of ten
to twelve chemicals into the air. This mixture attracts parasitic wasps 
that lay eggs inside the caterpillars. Plants may not be able to flee the scene
of an attack, or fight off predators with teeth
and claws, but with sturdy armor, a well-stocked chemical arsenal, a neighborhood watch, and cross-species alliances, a plant isn't always an easy meal.","Plants have amazing ways to defend themselves against threats. They have physical defenses like bark, waxy cuticles, thorns, spines, prickles, and trichomes. Some plants have chemical defenses like raphides and toxins. The mimosa plant can fold its leaves when touched. When physical defenses are breached, the plant immune system springs into action. Every cell has the ability to detect and defend against invaders. Plants can also alert nearby plants to release their own insect repellent. Some plants can even recruit allies like parasitic wasps to fight off caterpillars. Plants are not an easy meal!

14,14,8RI0JnB_OaE,The ferocious predatory dinosaurs of Cretaceous Sahara - Nizar Ibrahim,"There are few places on Earth 
less hospitable to life than the bone-dry Sahara Desert. Yet it wasn't always this way. 100 million years ago, during a period
known as the Mid-Cretaceous, a gargantuan river system flowed
across the region from modern day Egypt to Morocco. The whole world at that time
would look rather different to us. The continents had yet to assume
their current positions. Extreme temperatures were common and fierce storms made life unpredictable. Dinosaurs flourished on land, pterosaurs roamed the skies, and giant marine reptiles and sharks
swam in warm seas. Small mammals, our ancestors,
lived quite literally in the shadow of these extraordinary creatures. In this world of huge predators, the River of Giants, which is what some call this region
of what is now northern Africa, stood out as particularly dangerous. In most ecosystems, it's lonely at
the top of the food chain. There usually isn't enough prey
to sustain many predators. Yet an incredible variety of aquatic
prey species in the river-based ecosystem may have allowed a large and diverse
population of apex predators to coexist. We know this thanks to a wealth of fossils
we found in an area called the Kem Kem Beds. Many of the predators we've discovered
had head and body shapes that made them uniquely adapted
to hunt the different types and sizes of aquatic prey. This allowed many Kem Kem predators to
take full advantage of the one abundant food source
in this environment: fish. This also allowed them 
to avoid direct competition with the predators going after
land-loving animals. Prey species in the river system had to
contend with attacks from all sides, including from above. Flying reptiles dominated the skies. Alanqa Saharica had a wingspan of
up to nine meters, and long slender jaws that helped it
snatch fish and small terrestrial animals. At least seven different types 
of crocodile-like predators patrolled the waterways, including the roughly 
ten-meter-long Elosuchus. And multiple species of T-rex-sized
carnivorous dinosaurs called theropods, lived side by side. In the River of Giants,
Spinosaurus was king. This 15-meter-long dinosaur was even
longer than T-rex, with short muscular hind legs, a flexible tail, and broad feet. It's two-meter-high sail warned
other creatures of its fearsome size and may have also been 
used to attract mates. Spinosaurus' long slender jaws were spiked
with conical teeth, perfect for swiftly clamping down
on slippery aquatic prey. This apex predator, 
as well as its ecosystem, is unparalleled in the history
of life on Earth. All that's left of these 
fearsome predators are fossils. About 93 million years ago, 
sea levels rose, submerging the Kem Kem region
in a shallow sea. Tens of millions of years later, an asteroid impact, volcanic eruptions, and associated changes in climate wiped out the dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and
many other groups of animals and plants, including their unique ecoysystems. That mass extinction paved the way
for the rise of new kinds of birds, larger mammals, and eventually us.","The Sahara Desert was once a lush region with a river system called the River of Giants.

15,15,sz3Yv3On4lE,The three different ways mammals give birth - Kate Slabosky,"What do these animals have in common? More than you might think. Along with over 5,000 other species,
they're mammals, or members of class mammalia. All mammals are vertebrates,
meaning they have backbones. But mammals are distinguished 
from other vertebrates by a number of shared features. That includes warm blood, body hair or fur, the ability to breathe using lungs, and nourishing their young with milk. But despite these similarities, these creatures also have 
many biological differences, and one of the most remarkable
is how they give birth. Let's start with the most familiar,
placental mammals. This group includes humans, cats, dogs, giraffes, and even the blue whale,
the biggest animal on Earth. Its placenta, a solid disk
of blood-rich tissue, attaches to the wall of the uterus
to support the developing embryo. The placenta is what keeps
the calf alive during pregnancy. Directly connected to 
the mother's blood supply, it funnels nutrients and oxygen 
straight into the calf's body via the umbilical cord, and also exports its waste. Placental mammals can spend far
longer inside the womb than other mammals. Baby blue whales, for instance, spend
almost a full year inside their mother. The placenta keeps the calf alive
right up until its birth, when the umbilical cord breaks and the newborn's own respiratory, circulatory, and waste disposal systems take over. Measuring about 23 feet,
a newborn calf is already able to swim. It will spend the next six months drinking 225 liters of 
its mothers thick, fatty milk per day. Meanwhile, in Australia,
you can find a second type of mammal - marsupials. Marsupial babies are so tiny and delicate
when they're born that they must continue developing
in the mother's pouch. Take the quoll, one of the world's
smallest marsupials, which weighs only 18 milligrams at birth, the equivalent of about 30 sugar grains. The kangaroo, another marsupial, gives birth to a single 
jelly bean-sized baby at a time. The baby crawls down the middle
of the mother's three vaginas, then must climb up to the pouch, where she spends 
the next 6-11 months suckling. Even after the baby kangaroo leaves
this warm haven, she'll return to suckle milk. Sometimes, she's just one of three babies
her mother is caring for. A female kangaroo can often simultaneously
support one inside her uterus and another in her pouch. In unfavorable conditions, female kangaroos can pause
their pregnancies. When that happens, she's able
to produce two different kinds of milk, one for her newborn, and one for her older joey. The word mammalia means of the breast, which is a bit of a misnomer because while kangaroos do produce
milk from nipples in their pouches, they don't actually have breasts. Nor do monotremes, the third and arguably
strangest example of mammalian birth. There were once hundreds 
of monotreme species, but there are only five left: four species of echidnas
and the duck-billed platypus. The name monotreme means one hole referring to the single orifice they use
for reproduction, excretion, and egg-laying. Like birds, reptiles, fish, dinosaurs, and others, these species lay eggs instead
of giving birth to live young. Their eggs are soft-shelled, and when their babies hatch, they suckle
milk from pores on their mother's body until they're large enough 
to feed themselves. Despite laying eggs and other adaptations
that we associate more with non-mammals, like the duck-bill platypus's webbed feet, bill, and the venomous spur 
males have on their feet, they are, in fact, mammals. That's because they share the defining
characteristics of mammalia and are evolutionarily linked
to the rest of the class. Whether placental, marsupial, or monotreme, each of these creatures and its unique
birthing methods, however bizarre, have succeeded for many millennia
in bringing new life and diversity into the mammal kingdom.","Mammals are vertebrates with warm blood, body hair or fur, the ability to breathe using lungs, and nourishing their young with milk. There are three types of mammals based on how they give birth: placental, marsupial, and monotreme. Placental mammals, like humans, cats, dogs, giraffes, and blue whales, have a placenta that attaches to the wall of the uterus to support the developing embryo.

16,16,7m8QlSPP7t0,Why do animals have such different lifespans? - Joao Pedro de Magalhaes,"For the microscopic lab worm, C. elegans life equates to just 
a few short weeks on Earth. Compare that with the tortoise,
which can age to more than 100 years. Mice and rats reach the end of their lives
after just four years, while for the bowhead whale,
Earth's longest-lived mammal, death can come after 200. Like most living things, the vast majority of animals gradually
degenerate after reaching sexual maturity in the process known as aging. But what does it really mean to age? The drivers behind this process are varied
and complicated, but aging is ultimately 
caused by cell death and dysfunction. When we're young, 
we constantly regenerate cells in order to replace dead and dying ones. But as we age, this process slows down. In addition, older cells don't perform
their functions as well as young ones. That makes our bodies go into a decline, which eventually results 
in disease and death. But if that's consistently true, why the huge variance in aging patterns
and lifespan within the animal kingdom? The answer lies in several factors, including environment and body size. These can place powerful evolutionary
pressures on animals to adapt, which in turn makes the aging process
different across species. Consider the cold depths of the Atlantic
and Arctic Seas, where Greenland sharks can live
to over 400 years, and the Arctic clam known as the quahog
can live up to 500. Perhaps the most impressive of these
ocean-dwelling ancients is the Antarctic glass sponge, which can survive over 10,000 years
in frigid waters. In cold environments like these,
heartbeats and metabolic rates slow down. Researchers theorize that this also
causes a slowing of the aging process. In this way, the environment 
shapes longevity. When it comes to size, 
it's often, but not always, the case that larger species have a longer
lifespan than smaller ones. For instance, an elephant or whale
will live much longer than a mouse, rat, or vole, which in turn have years on flies
and worms. Some small animals, like worms and flies, are also limited by the mechanics 
of their cell division. They're mostly made up of cells that can't
divide and be replaced when damaged, so their bodies expire more quickly. And size is a powerful evolutionary driver
in animals. Smaller creatures are more prone
to predators. A mouse, for instance, can hardly expect
to survive more than a year in the wild. So, it has evolved to grow and reproduce
more rapidly, like an evolutionary defense mechanism
against its shorter lifespan. Larger animals, by contrast, are better
at fending off predators, and so they have the luxury of time
to grow to large sizes and reproduce multiple times
during their lives. Exceptions to the size rule include bats,
birds, moles, and turtles, but in each case, these animals have other
adaptations that allow them to escape predators. But there are still cases where animals
with similar defining features, like size and habitat, age at completely different rates. In these cases, genetic differences, like how each organism's cells
respond to threats, often account for the discrepancies
in longevity. So it's the combination 
of all these factors playing out to differing degrees
in different animals that explains the variability we see
in the animal kingdom. So what about us? Humans currently have 
an average life expectancy of 71 years, meaning that we're not even close to being
the longest living inhabitants on Earth. But we are very good at increasing
our life expectancy. In the early 1900s, humans only lived
an average of 50 years. Since then, we've learned to adapt
by managing many of the factors that cause deaths, like environmental exposure
and nutrition. This, and other increases 
in life expectancy make us possibly the only species
on Earth to take control over our natural fate.","Animals have different lifespans due to various factors, including environment and body size. Cold environments, like the Atlantic and Arctic Seas, can cause a slowing of the aging process in animals like the Greenland shark and the Arctic clam. Larger animals, like elephants and whales, tend to live longer than smaller ones, like mice and rats. However, there are exceptions, like bats, birds, moles, and turtles. Genetic differences can also account for differences in longevity in animals with similar defining features.

17,17,5j9Syov0AAw,How do animals experience pain? - Robyn J. Crook,"Humans know the surprising
prick of a needle, the searing pain of a stubbed toe 
and the throbbing of a toothache. We can identify many types of pain 
and have multiple ways of treating it. But what about other species? How do the animals all around us 
experience pain? It’s important that we find out. We keep animals as pets,
they enrich our environment, we farm many species for food, and we use them in experiments to advance
science and human health. Animals are clearly important to us, so it’s equally important that we
avoid causing them unnecessary pain. For animals that are similar to us,
like mammals, it's often obvious when they're hurting. But there's a lot that isn't obvious, like whether pain relievers that
work on us also help them. And the more different
an animal is from us, the harder it is to understand
their experience. How do you tell whether a shrimp 
is in pain? A snake? A snail? In vertebrates— including humans— pain 
can be split into two distinct processes. In the first, nerves in the skin 
sense something harmful and communicate that information
to the spinal cord. There, motor neurons activate movements
that make us rapidly jerk away from the threat. This is the physical recognition of harm 
called nociception. And nearly all animals, even those
with very simple nervous systems, experience it. Without this ability, animals would be 
unable to avoid harm and their survival would be threatened. The second part is the conscious
recognition of harm. In humans, this occurs when the sensory
neurons in our skin make a second round of connections 
via the spinal cord to the brain. There, millions of neurons in multiple
regions create the sensations of pain. For us, this is a very complex experience
associated with emotions like fear, panic and stress, 
which we can communicate to others. But it’s harder to know exactly 
how animals experience this part the process, because most of them
can’t show us what they feel. However, we get clues from observing
how animals behave. Wild, hurt animals are known
to nurse their wounds, make noises to show their distress,
and become reclusive. in the lab, scientists have discovered 
that animals like chickens and rats will self-administer pain-reducing 
drugs if they’re hurting. Animals also avoid situations 
where they’ve been hurt before, which suggests awareness of threats. We’ve reached the point that
research has made us so sure that vertebrates recognize pain that it’s illegal in many countries
to needlessly harm these animals. But what about other types 
of animals, like invertebrates? These animals aren't legally protected, partly because their behaviors
are harder to read. We can make good guesses about some of
them, like oysters, worms and jellyfish. These are examples of animals 
that either lack a brain or have a very simple one. So an oyster may recoil when squirted
with lemon juice, for instance, because of nociception. But with such a simple nervous system, it’s unlikely to experience 
the conscious part of pain. Other invertebrate animals are 
more complicated, though. Like the octopus, 
which has a sophisticated brain and is thought to be one of the most 
intelligent invertebrate animals. Yet in many countries, people continue
the practice of eating live octopus. We also boil live crayfish,
shrimp, and crabs, even though we don't really know
how they're affected either. This poses an ethical problem, because we may be causing these
animals unnecessary suffering. Scientific experimentation, 
though controversial, gives us some clues. Tests on hermit crabs show that they’ll
leave an undesirable shell if they’re zapped with electricity. But stay if it’s a good shell. And octopi that might originally 
curl up an injured arm to protect it, will risk using it to catch prey. That suggests that these animals make
value judgments around sensory input, instead of just reacting
reflexively to harm. Meanwhile, crabs have been known
to repeatedly rub a spot on their bodies where they’ve received an electric shock. And even sea slugs flinch when they
know they’re about to receive a noxious stimulus. That means they have
some memory of physical sensations. We still have a lot to learn
about animal pain. As our knowledge grows, it may
one day allow us to live in a world where we don’t cause pain needlessly.","Animals experience pain differently from humans, and it's important to understand how they do to avoid causing them unnecessary harm. Vertebrates, like mammals, experience pain in two distinct processes: nociception, the physical recognition of harm, and the conscious recognition of harm. Invertebrates, like shrimp, snails, and snakes, also experience nociception, but it's harder to determine if they experience the conscious recognition of harm. Scientists use animal behavior to make educated guesses about their pain experience. For example, wild, hurt animals nurse their wounds, make noises to show their distress, and become reclusive. Invertebrates with more complex nervous systems, like octopuses, may also experience the conscious recognition of harm. However, more research is needed to determine the pain experience of invertebrates fully."
18,18,gBRcOLcEwF0,What’s so great about the Great Lakes? - Cheri Dobbs and Jennifer Gabrys,"What's so great about the Great Lakes? They're known as America's inland seas. The North American Great Lakes Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, and Superior are so massive
that they border eight states and contain 23 quadrillion
liters of water. That's enough to cover the land area
of the contiguous United States three meters deep. These vast bodies of water span forest, grassland, and wetland habitats, supporting a region that's home to over
3,500 species. But how did such a vast and unique
geological feature come to be? The story begins near the end
of the last ice age over 10,000 years ago, a time when the climate was warming and the glaciers that cloaked the Earth's
surface began their slow retreat. These immense ice sheets carved out
a series of basins. Those basins filled with water
as the ice began to melt, creating the world's largest area
of freshwater lakes. Over time, channels developed between
these basins, and water began to flow in
an ongoing exchange that persists to this day. In fact, today,
the interconnected Great Lakes contain almost 20% of the world's supply
of fresh surface water. The water's journey begins in
the far north of Lake Superior, which is the deepest, coldest,
and clearest of the lakes, containing half the system's water. Lake Superior sinks to depths
of 406 meters, creating a unique and diverse ecosystem
that includes more that 80 fish species. A given drop of water spends on average
200 years in this lake before flowing into Lake Michigan
or Lake Huron. Linked by the Straits of Mackinac,
these two lakes are technically one. To the west lies Lake Michigan, the third largest of the lakes
by surface area. Water slowly moves through
its cul-de-sac shape and encounters the world's largest
freshwater dunes, many wildlife species, and unique fossilized coral. To the east is Lake Huron,
which has the longest shoreline. It's sparsely populated,
but heavily forested, including 7,000-year-old petrified trees. Below them, water continues to flow
southeastwards from Lake Huron into Lake Erie. This lake's status as the warmest
and shallowest of the five has ensured an abundance of animal life,
including millions of migrating birds. Finally, the water reaches its last stop
by dramatically plunging more than 50 meters down
the thundering Niagara Falls into Lake Ontario, the smallest lake
by surface area. From there, some of this well-traveled
water enters the St. Lawrence River, eventually reaching the Atlantic Ocean. In addition to being a natural wonder, the perpetually flowing Great Lakes
bring us multiple benefits. They provide natural water filtration, flood control, and nutrients cycling. By moving water across
more than 3,200 kilometers, the Great Lakes also provide drinking
water for upward of 40 million people and 212 billion liters a day
for the industries and farms that line their banks. But our dependence on the system is
having a range of negative impacts, too. The Great Lakes coastal habitats are being
degraded and increasingly populated, exposing the once pristine waters to industrial, urban,
and agricultural pollutants. Because less than 1% of the water
leaves the Lake's system annually, decades-old pollutants still lurk
in its waters. Humans have also inadvertently introduced more than 100 non-native
and invasive species into the lakes, such as zebra and quagga mussels,
and sea lampreys that have decimated some indigenous
fish populations. On a larger scale, climate change
is causing the waters to warm, thus reducing water levels and changing
the distribution of aquatic life. Luckily, in recent years, governments have
started to recognize the immense value of this natural resource. Partnerships between the United States and
Canada are underway to reduce pollution, protect coastal habitats, and halt the spread of invasive species. Protecting something as massive
as the Great Lakes system will require the collaboration
of many organizations, but the effort is critical if we can preserve the wonder
of this flowing inland sea.","The Great Lakes are known as America's inland seas, spanning eight states and supporting over 3,500 species. They were formed over 10,000 years ago when glaciers retreated, leaving behind carved basins that filled with water. The lakes are interconnected, with water flowing from Lake Superior to Lake Ontario and then into the Atlantic Ocean. The lakes provide natural water filtration, flood control, and nutrients cycling, as well as drinking water for 40 million people. However, the lakes are facing negative impacts from pollution, invasive species, and climate change. Governments are working together to protect the lakes, but it will require collaboration from many organizations to preserve this natural wonder.

19,19,QtJqBiF6EF0,Why do we kiss under mistletoe? - Carlos Reif,"The sight of mistletoe may either send
you scurrying or if you have your eye on someone, awaiting an opportunity
beneath its snow white berries. But how did the festive Christmas 
tradition of kissing under mistletoe come about? The long lived custom intertwines 
the mythology and biology of this intriguing plant. There are more than 1,000 species of
mistletoe which grows the world over. In fact, the ancient Europeans
were so captivated by the plant’s unusual growth habits 
that they included it in their legends and myths. In ancient Rome, Pliny the Elder 
described how the Druid priesthood in ancient England
believed that mistletoe was a plant dropped down from heaven 
by the gods; that explained its unlikely position 
amongst the high branches of certain trees. They also believed it had powers 
of healing and bestowing fertility. Meanwhile, Scandinavian legends told 
of the plant’s mystical qualities in the story of the god Baldur
and his adoring mother, Frigg, goddess of love, marriage and fertility. Frigg loved her son so much 
that she commanded every plant, animal and inanimate object to vow 
they’d never harm him. In her fervor, however, 
she overlooked the mistletoe. The mischievous god Loki realized 
this oversight, and pierced Baldur’s heart with an arrow 
carved from a mistletoe branch. Frigg cried tears of such
sadness that they formed the mistletoe’s pearly berries, making the other gods pity her 
and agree to resurrect Baldur. Hearing the news, Frigg became 
so overjoyed that she transformed the mistletoe from a symbol of death
into one of peace and love. She mandated a one day
truce for all fights and that everyone embraced beneath 
its branches when they passed to spread more love into the world. In the 17th century, British colonists 
arriving in the New World found a different but very similar looking
species of mistletoe. They applied it to these tales
of magic, fertility and love, spreading the mistletoe hanging tradition
from Europe into America. By the 18th century, people 
in Britain had turned this into a Christmas tradition. But this custom comes down to more 
than just human imagination. All of it was inspired
by the plant’s intriguing biology. We see mistletoe as a festive decoration,
but draped on tree boughs in the wild, it’s known as a partly parasitic plant. Mistletoe relies on modified roots
called haustoria that penetrate the tree bark 
and siphon off the water and minerals trees carry up their trunks. To colonize nearby trees with its seeds, mistletoe depends on birds 
and other creatures to do the dispersing. Birds that eat the mistletoe’s 
sticky white berries sometimes get rid of the gluey seeds
by wiping them off onto tree bark, or with a bit of luck, they excrete the indigestible seed
onto a tree where it germinates and starts to grow. With its resilience and foliage 
that stays lush even while the surrounding trees 
lose their leaves, you can see why mistletoe captivated
our superstitious ancestors. They saw these as signs of the plant’s
magical qualities and fertility. Even today, the mistletoe inspires wonder with the diversity of wildlife
it supports. More than just a parasite, 
it’s also known as a keystone species. It's eaten by a diversity of animals,
including deer, elk, squirrels, chipmunks, porcupines, robins, bluebirds, 
mourning doves, and the butterfly genus Delius. Some mistletoe species
produce dense bushes, which are excellent nesting locations
for a variety of birds. And despite their parasitic
relationship with trees, mistletoes can also help other plants. For instance, juniper sprouts 
near mistletoe to benefit from the visiting berry-eating birds. Through the many benefits it provides, mistletoe influences diversity 
and allows ecosystems to flourish. You might even say, 
that for this iconic plant, life imitates legend. In the wild, mistletoe has the power 
to bring things together. And in our own traditions 
we see that happening too.","Mistletoe is a plant with over 1,000 species that grows worldwide.

20,20,GLllZ-qiXJA,Do we really need pesticides? - Fernan Pérez-Gálvez,"In 1845, Ireland's vast potato fields
were struck by an invasive fungal disease that rapidly infested this staple crop. The effect was devastating. One million people died of famine, and over a million more were forced
to leave Ireland. Nowadays, we avoid such agricultural
catastrophes with the help of pesticides. Those are a range of manmade chemicals
that control insects, unwanted weeds, funguses, rodents, and bacteria that may threaten our food supply. They've become an essential part
of our food system. As populations have grown,
monoculture, single crop farming, has helped us feed people efficiently. But it's also left our food
vulnerable to extensive attack by pests. In turn, we've become more dependent
on pesticides. Today, we annually shower over 5 billion
pounds of pesticides across the Earth to control these unwanted visitors. The battle against pests,
especially insects, has marked agriculture's long history. Records from thousands of years ago suggest that humans actively burned
some of their crops after harvest to rid them of pests. There's even evidence from ancient times
that we recruited other insects to help. In 300 A.D., Chinese farmers specially
bred ferocious predatory ants in orange orchards
to protect the trees from other bugs. Later, as large-scale farming spread, we began sprinkling arsenic, lead,
and copper treatments on crops. But these were incredibly toxic
to humans as well. As our demand for more, 
safer produce increased, so did the need for effective chemicals that could control pests
on a grander scale. This ushered in the era 
of chemical pesticides. In 1948, a Swiss chemist named
Paul Hermann Müller was awarded a Nobel Prize 
for his discovery of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane,
also known as DDT. This new molecule had unparalleled power
to control many insect species until the 1950s,
when insects became resistant to it. Worse, the chemical actually drove
dramatic declines in bird populations, poisoned water sources, and was eventually found to cause
long-term health problems in humans. By 1972, DDT had been banned
in the United States, and yet traces still linger
in the environment today. Since then, chemists have been searching
for alternatives. With each new wave of inventions,
they've encountered the same obstacle - rapid species evolution. As pesticides destroy pest populations, they leave behind 
only the most resistant individuals. They then pass on their 
pesticide-resisting genes to the next generation. That's lead to the rise of super bugs, such as the Colorado potato beetle, which is resistant to over 
50 different insecticides. Another downside is that other bugs
get caught in the crossfire. Some of these are helpful predators
of plant pests or vital pollinators, so erasing them from agriculture
wipes out their benefits, too. Pesticides have improved over time and are currently regulated by strict
safety standards, but they still have the potential
to pollute soil and water, impact wildlife, and even harm us. So considering all these risks,
why do we continue using pesticides? Although they're imperfect, they currently may be our best bet
against major agricultural disasters, not to mention mosquito-born diseases. Today, scientists are on a quest for
alternative pest control strategies that balance the demands
of food production with environmental concerns. Nature has become a major source
of inspiration, from natural plant and fungal chemicals
that can repel or attract insects, to recruiting other insects 
as crop bodyguards. We're also turning to high-tech solutions,
like drones. Programmed to fly over crops, these machines can use 
their sensors and GPS to carry out more targeted sprays that limit a pesticide's wider 
environmental impact. With a combination 
of biological understanding, environmental awareness, and improved technologies, we have a better chance of finding
a holistic solution to pests. Chemical pesticides may never shake
their controversial reputation, but with their help, we can ensure that 
agricultural catastrophes stay firmly in our past.","Pesticides are chemicals used to control pests that threaten our food supply. They became essential as monoculture farming left crops vulnerable to extensive pest attacks. Today, we use over 5 billion pounds of pesticides annually. The history of pesticides dates back to ancient times when humans burned crops or used other insects as protection. The first chemical pesticide, DDT, was discovered in 1948, but it was later banned due to its harmful effects on humans and the environment.

21,21,mQePz62zkqA,Why are there so many types of apples? - Theresa Doud,"Have you ever walked into a grocery store and wondered where all those variety
of apples came from? You might find SnapDragon, Pixie Crunch, Cosmic Crisp, Jazz, or Ambrosia next to the more familiar
Red Delicious and Granny Smith. These delightfully descriptive names belong to just a handful of the over
7,500 apple varieties in the world. This huge diversity exists largely because
of humanity's efforts to bear new fruit. Fruit breeding is a way to fulfill
the expectations of farmers and consumers who seek specific qualities in an apple. On the one hand, farmers may want them
to be disease-resistant and to store well. On the other, consumers are swayed
by appearance, taste, and novelty. So, breeders have to consider everything from how well apples grow
in certain climates to their color, taste, and size. And sometimes finding the perfect
fit means breeding something new. To create apples 
with desirable characteristics, breeders first need to find parent
apples that carry those characteristics. Once the parents have been selected, they have to wait until the trees
bloom in the spring. The breeder takes the pollen
from one bloom, called the father, and transfers it by hand to the other
parent bloom, called the mother, through a process 
called cross-pollination. Once the mother bloom 
turns into an apple, the seeds are collected and then planted. It takes about five years for these seeds
to grow into trees that produce apples, but because of the way 
traits are inherited, all of the seedlings produced will have
different sets of genes and characteristics. This means that to achieve 
a desired quality, it takes a lot of offspring, not to mention patience 
on the breeder's part. When a seedling does bear fruit
with the desired qualities, it's selected for further evaluation. Of the original crossed seedlings, about one in every 5,000 makes it
to this prestigious stage. They're then sent to new farms where breeders can assess how various
climates and soil types affect the plant's growth. The fruit of the seedling 
and its many clones must then be collected and sampled
to ensure consistency. Breeders study about 45 traits
in an apple, like the texture 
and firmness of the flesh, when it ripens, how sugary its juice is, and how long it stays fresh. Over several years, they weed out
all the bad apples, selecting only those 
whose fruits are the best. These exclusive plants 
officially form the cultivar, or new apple variety. To ensure an exact copy of this cultivar, all apple trees must be grafted 
from the original seedling. Branches, called scion wood, are cut from the original tree 
and grown to generate more scion wood. Segments of these trees are then grafted
onto root stalk - that's the lower section of another tree that's been chosen 
from a different cultivar for its superior roots 
and growing ability. Finally, this fusion creates 
a new apple tree with the desired qualities. Each new plant takes up to four years before it starts producing 
the fruit we eat. Apple breeding may be a difficult art,
but it's accessible to all: universities, companies, and even individuals can create
new cultivars. But to fully own an apple, the breeder
faces a final challenge - naming the fruit. After a cultivar is patented, a breeder chooses a name
for its trademark. That final step grants them long-lasting
rights over the apple and its clones. That name must be completely original, and the catchier, the better, of course. With over 7,500 varieties and counting, that's why we have apples called
Pink Lady, Sweet Tango, Kiku, and EverCrisp. The more we work with nature's bounty
to breed new cultivars, the more creative and delectable
these names will become.","There are over 7,500 apple varieties worldwide due to human efforts to create new fruit with specific qualities. Apple breeding involves selecting parent apples with desired characteristics, cross-pollinating them, collecting seeds, and planting them. After five years, seedlings produce apples, but only one in 5,000 has the desired qualities. These are evaluated for 45 traits, and the best ones become a new cultivar. Grafting ensures an exact copy of the cultivar. Apple breeding is accessible to all, and breeders face the challenge of naming the fruit after patenting it. The more we breed new cultivars, the more creative and delectable the names will become.

22,22,gFzqqaBA9wQ,How smart are orangutans? - Lu Gao,"Fu Manchu was one of the most
notorious escape artists at the Omaha Zoo in the 1960s. But he wasn't a performer, he was an orangutan. The keepers who locked 
his enclosure every night were baffled to find him outside
the next day hanging out with friends in a tree, or sunning on the roof. Only after installing cameras 
did they realize Fu Manchu had been picking the lock with a metal wire that he kept hidden
under his cheek pouch. The keepers shouldn't have been
surprised at Fu Manchu's cunningness. Along with our other great ape cousins, the gorillas, chimps, and bonobos, they belong to our Hominidae
family tree, which stretches back 14 million years. But it's not just their striking red hair that makes orangutans unique 
among our cousins. As the only great apes from Asia, orangutans have adapted to a life
high in the rain forest canopies. Many of the skills they learn
are transmitted through the special bond they have with their mothers, the most extended in the animal kingdom
next to humans. Orangutan mothers usually give birth
to one baby at a time, waiting up to eight years before
having another. This gives the young, who begin as fully dependent infants, plenty of time to learn how to climb and distinguish the hundreds of plants
and fruits that make up their diet. Female orangutans even stay with
their mothers into their teen years to learn child-rearing. As they grow up, orangutans also develop
a complex set of cooperative social skills by interacting with their peers
and siblings. Much like ourselves, young orangutans involuntarily mimic
the facial expressions and emotions of their playmates, with behaviors that closely parallel
human smiling and laughter. Once they finally venture out 
on their own, orangutans continue to develop
their resourcefulness, putting the skills they've learned 
into practice. Adults build a new nest each night
by carefully weaving twigs together, topping them with soft leaves,
pillows, and blankets. This process requires dexterity,
coordination, and an eye for design. Orangutans also use a variety of tools
to make their lives in the jungle easier. They turn branches into fly swatters
and back scratchers, construct umbrellas when it rains, make gloves from leafy pads, and even use leaves as bandages
to dress their wounds. But orangutan intelligence goes far
beyond jungle survival. Research in controlled environments
has shown that orangutans are self-aware, being one of the few species to recognize
their own reflections. They also display remarkable foresight,
planning, and cognition. In one experiment, researchers taught
an orangutan to use a straw to extract his favorite fruit soup
from a box. That orangutan was later given the choice
between the straw or a grape that could be 
eaten right away, and he chose the straw just in case
he was given another box of soup. In another experiment, orangutans figured
out how to reach peanuts at the bottom of long tubes
by spitting water into them. While orangutans are able to pass
cognitive tests with flying colors, there are certain problems that they
need our help to solve. Indonesia has the world's highest rate
of deforestation, and millions of acres of rain forest 
are burned annually to support the logging 
and palm oil industries. Deforestation exposes the 30,000
orangutans remaining in the wild to poachers. They kill mothers so that baby orangutans
can be sold as exotic pets. But fortunately, the story often
doesn't end here. Orphans can be confiscated
and given a second chance. At special forest schools, they recover
from emotional trauma and continue to develop 
essential life skills. Against all odds, these orphans 
demonstrate incredible resilience and readiness to learn. In Malay, the word orangutan translates
literally to ""the person of the forest,"" a reminder of our common lineage. And despite orangutans being some
of the smartest animals on Earth, outsmarting their extinction requires
the creativity, empathy, and foresight that our species share.","Orangutans are highly intelligent members of the Hominidae family, which includes humans, gorillas, chimps, and bonobos. They are the only great apes from Asia and have adapted to life in the rainforest canopies. Orangutan mothers have the longest bond with their offspring in the animal kingdom, next to humans, teaching them essential survival skills. Adult orangutans build nests, use tools, and display complex social behaviors. They are self-aware, plan for the future, and solve problems. However, deforestation in Indonesia threatens their survival. Orangutan orphans can be saved and rehabilitated, demonstrating resilience and readiness to learn.

23,23,t3CjTU7TaNA,How do animals see in the dark? - Anna Stöckl,"To human eyes, the world at night
is a formless canvas of grey. Many nocturnal animals, on the other hand, experience a rich and varied world
bursting with details, shapes, and colors. What is it, then, that separates moths
from men? Moths and many other nocturnal animals
see at night because their eyes are adapted 
to compensate for the lack of light. All eyes, whether nocturnal or not, depend on photoreceptors in the retina
to detect light particles, known as photons. Photoreceptors then report information
about these photons to other cells in the retina and brain. The brain sifts through that information
and uses it to build up an image of the environment the eye perceives. The brighter the light is,
the more photons hit the eye. On a sunny day, upwards of 100 million times 
more photons are available to the eye than on a cloudy, moonless night. Photons aren't just less numerous 
in darkness, but they also hit the eye 
in a less reliable way. This means the information 
that photoreceptors collect will vary over time, as will the quality of the image. In darkness, trying to detect the sparse
scattering of randomly arriving photons is too difficult for the eyes
of most daytime animals. But for night creatures, 
it's just a matter of adaptation. One of these adaptations is size. Take the tarsier, whose eyeballs
are each as big as its brain, giving it the biggest eyes compared 
to head size of all mammals. If humans had the same brain to eye ratio,
our eyes would be the size of grapefruits. The tarsier's enlarged orbs haven't 
evolved to make it cuter, however, but to gather as much light as possible. Bigger eyes can have larger openings,
called pupils, and larger lenses, allowing for more light to be focused
on the receptors. While tarsiers scan the nocturnal scene
with their enormous peepers, cats use gleaming eyes to do the same. Cats' eyes get their shine from
a structure called the tapetum lucidum that sits behind the photoreceptors. This structure is made from layers
of mirror-like cells containing crystals that send incoming light
bouncing back towards the photoreceptors and out of the eye. This results in an eerie glow, and it also gives the photoreceptors
a second chance to detect photons. In fact, this system has inspired the
artificial cats' eyes we use on our roads. Toads, on the other hand, have adapted
to take it slow. They can form an image even when just a single photon 
hits each photoreceptor per second. They accomplish this with photoreceptors that are more than 25 times slower 
than human ones. This means toads can collect photons
for up to four seconds, allowing them to gather many more
than our eyes do at each visual time interval. The downside is that this causes toads
to react very slowly because they're only receiving
an updated image every four seconds. Fortunately, they're accustomed
to targeting sluggish prey. Meanwhile, the night is also buzzing
with insects, such as hawk moths, which can see their favorite flowers
in color, even on a starlit night. They achieve this by a surprising move - getting rid of details 
in their visual perception. Information from neighboring
photoreceptors is grouped in their brains, so the photon catch of each group
is higher compared to individual receptors. However, grouping photoreceptors
loses details in the image, as fine details require a fine grid
of photoreceptors, each detecting photons from one
small point in space. The trick is to balance the need
for photons with the loss of detail to still find their flowers. Whether eyes are slow, enormous,
shiny, or coarse, it's the combination 
of these biological adaptations that gives nocturnal animals their unique
visual powers. Imagine what it might be like to witness
through their eyes the world that wakes up
when the Sun goes down.","Humans can't see much in the dark, but nocturnal animals experience a rich and colorful world at night. This is because their eyes are adapted to gather and process light more efficiently. Some animals, like tarsiers, have huge eyes to capture as much light as possible. Cats have a tapetum lucidum, a structure that reflects light back to the photoreceptors, giving them a second chance to detect photons. Toads have slow photoreceptors, allowing them to gather more photons over time. Hawk moths can see their favorite flowers in color at night by grouping photoreceptors in their brains, which increases the photon catch but loses image details. These adaptations enable nocturnal animals to thrive in low-light conditions."
24,24,FK9xHry877U,What is the biggest single-celled organism? - Murry Gans,"The elephant is a creature
of epic proportions, and yet it owes its enormity to more
than 1,000 trillion microscopic cells, and on the epically small end of things, there are likely millions 
of unicellular species, yet there are very few we can see
with the naked eye. Why is that? Why don't we get unicellular elephants, or blue whales, or brown bears? To find out, we have to peer into
a cell's guts. This is where most 
of the cell's functions occur, enclosed by a cellular membrane that acts as the doorway into 
and out of the cell. Any resources the cell needs to consume, or waste products it needs to expel, first have to pass through this membrane. But there's a biological quirk 
in this set up. A cell's surface and volume increase
at different rates. Cells come in many shapes, but imagining them as cubes will make
the math easy to calculate. A cube has six faces. These represent the cell membrane,
and make up its surface area. A cube measuring one micrometer
on each side, that's one millionth of a meter, would have a total surface area
of six square micrometers. And its volume would be 
one cubic micrometer. This would give us six units 
of surface area for every single unit of volume, a six to one ratio. But things change dramatically
if we make the cube ten times bigger, measuring ten micrometers on each side. This cell would have a surface area
of 600 square micrometers and a volume of one thousand
cubic micrometers, a ratio of only .6 to one. That's less than one unit of surface area
to service each unit of volume. As the cube grows, its volume increases
much faster than its surface area. The interior would overtake the membrane, leaving too little surface area for things
to quickly move in and out of the cell. A huge cell would back up with waste
and eventually die and disintegrate. There's another plus to having multitudes
of smaller cells, too. It's hardly a tragedy if one gets 
punctured, infected, or destroyed. Now, there are some 
exceptionally large cells that have adapted to cheat the system, like the body's longest cell, a neuron that stretches from the base
of the spine to the foot. To compensate for its length,
it's really thin, just a few micrometers in diameter. Another example can be found
in your small intestine, where structures called villi
fold up into little fingers. Each villus is made of cells with highly
folded membranes that have tiny bumps called microvilli
to increase their surface area. But what about single-celled organisms? Caulerpa taxifolia, a green algae
that can reach 30 centimeters long, is believed to be the largest 
single-celled organism in the world thanks to its unique biological hacks. Its surface area is enhanced with
a frond-like structure. It uses photosynthesis to assemble
its own food molecules and it's coenocytic. That means it's a single cell
with multiple nuclei, making it like a multicellular organism
but without the divisions between cells. Yet even the biggest unicellular organisms
have limits, and none grows nearly as large
as the elephant, whale, or bear. But within every big creature
are trillions of minuscule cells perfectly suited in all their tininess to keeping the Earth's giants 
lumbering along.","The video explains why there are no single-celled organisms as big as elephants or blue whales. The reason is that a cell's surface area and volume increase at different rates. As a cell grows, its volume increases faster than its surface area, making it difficult for resources to enter and waste products to exit. The largest single-celled organism is Caulerpa taxifolia, a green algae that can reach 30 centimeters long. It has a frond-like structure that enhances its surface area and is coenocytic, meaning it has multiple nuclei. However, even the biggest unicellular organisms have limits, and none grows nearly as large as the elephant, whale, or bear. The video concludes by emphasizing that every big creature has trillions of tiny cells that help them function.

Curious facts:

* A cell's surface area and volume increase at different rates, making it difficult for resources to enter and waste products to exit as the cell grows.

25,25,dO2xx-aeZ4w,How a single-celled organism almost wiped out life on Earth - Anusuya Willis,"There's an organism 
that changed the world. It caused both the first mass extinction
in Earth's history and also paved the way for complex life. How? By sending the first free oxygen
molecules into our atmosphere, and they did all this
as single-celled life forms. They're cyanobacteria, and the story of these simple organisms that don't even have nuclei 
or any other organelles is a pivotal chapter 
in the story of life on Earth. Earth's atmosphere wasn't always 
the oxygen-rich mixture we breathe today. 3.5 billion years ago, the atmosphere
was mostly nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane. Almost all oxygen was locked up 
in molecules like water, not floating around in the air. The oceans were populated by
anaerobic microbes. Those are simple, unicellular life forms
that thrive without oxygen and get energy by scavenging
what molecules they find. But somewhere between 
2.5 and 3.5 billion years ago, one of these microbial species, probably floating 
on the surface of the ocean, evolved a new ability: photosynthesis. Structures in their cell membrane
could harness the energy from sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water
into oxygen gas and sugars, which they could use for energy. Those organisms were the ancestors
of what we now call cyanobacteria. Their bluish color comes from 
the blue-green pigments that capture the sunlight they need. Photosynthesis gave those ancient bacteria
a huge advantage over other species. They could now produce their own energy from an almost endless supply 
of raw ingredients, so their populations exploded and they started polluting the atmosphere
with a new waste product: oxygen. At first, the trickle of extra oxygen was
soaked up by chemical reactions with iron or decomposing cells, but after a few hundred million years, the cyanobacteria were producing oxygen
faster than it could be absorbed, and the gas started building up
in the atmosphere. That was a big problem for the rest
of Earth's inhabitants. Oxygen-rich air 
was actually toxic to them. The result? About 2.5 billion years ago was a mass
extinction of virtually all life on Earth, which barely spared the cyanobacteria. Geologists call this
the Great Oxygenation Event, or even the Oxygen Catastrophe. That wasn't the only problem. Methane had been acting as a potent
greenhouse gas that kept the Earth warm, but now, the extra oxygen reacted with
methane to form carbon dioxide and water, which don't trap as much heat. The thinner atmospheric blanket caused Earth's first, 
and possibly longest, ice age, the Huronian Glaciation. The planet was basically 
one giant snowball for several hundred million years. Eventually, life adjusted. Aerobic organisms, 
which can use oxygen for energy, started sopping up some of the excess
gas in the atmosphere. The oxygen concentration rose and fell until eventually it reached 
the approximate 21% we have today. And being able to use 
the chemical energy in oxygen gave organisms the boost they needed
to diversify and evolve more complex forms. Cyanobacteria had a part 
to play in that story, too. Hundreds of millions of years ago, some other prehistoric microbe
swallowed a cyanobacterium whole in a process called endosymbiosis. In doing so, that microbe acquired
its own internal photosynthesis factory. This was the ancestor of plant cells. And cyanobacteria became chloroplasts, the organelles that carry out 
photosynthesis today. Cyanobacteria are still around
in almost every environment on Earth: oceans, fresh water, soil, antarctic rocks, sloth fur. They still pump oxygen
into the atmosphere, and they also pull nitrogen out to
fertilize the plants they helped create. We wouldn't recognize life on Earth
without them. But also thanks to them, we almost didn't have 
life on Earth at all.","Cyanobacteria, single-celled organisms, caused the first mass extinction on Earth and paved the way for complex life. They evolved photosynthesis, producing oxygen and sugars, giving them an advantage over other species. The oxygen they released caused the Great Oxygenation Event, a mass extinction of virtually all life on Earth. The excess oxygen also reacted with methane, causing Earth's first and longest ice age. Life eventually adjusted, and aerobic organisms used the excess oxygen for energy. Cyanobacteria also played a role in the evolution of plant cells. They are still around, producing oxygen and pulling nitrogen out to fertilize plants. Without them, life on Earth would not be recognizable."
26,26,jzqnUvE66HA,How North America got its shape - Peter J. Haproff,"The geography of our planet is in flux. Each continent has ricocheted around
the globe on one or more tectonic plates, changing quite dramatically with time. Today, we'll focus on North America and how its familiar landscape
and features emerged over hundreds 
of millions of years. Our story begins about 
750 million years ago. As the super continent Rodinia
becomes unstable, it rifts along what's now the west coast
of North America to create the Panthalassa Ocean. You're seeing an ancestral continent
called Laurentia, which grows over the next few hundred
million years as island chains collide with it
and add land mass. We're now at 400 million years ago. Off today's east coast, the massive
African plate inches westward, closing the ancient Iapetus Ocean. It finally collides with Laurentia 
at 250 million years to form another supercontinent Pangea. The immense pressure causes
faulting and folding, stacking up rock to form 
the Appalachian Mountains. Let's fast forward a bit. About 100 million years later,
Pangea breaks apart, opening the Southern Atlantic Ocean between the new North American Plate
and the African Plate. We forge ahead, and now the eastward-moving 
Farallon Plate converges with the present-day west coast. The Farallon Plate's greater density
makes it sink beneath North America. This is called subduction, and it diffuses water into
the magma-filled mantle. That lowers the magma's melting point and makes it rise into the overlying
North American plate. From a subterranean chamber,
the magma travels upwards and erupts along a chain of volcanos. Magma still deep underground slowly cools, crystallizing to form solid rock, including the granite now found
in Yosemite National Park and the Sierra Nevada Mountains. We'll come back to that later. Now, it's 85 million years ago. The Farallon Plate becomes less steep, causing volcanism to stretch eastward
and eventually cease. As the Farallon Plate subducts, it compresses North America, thrusting up mountain ranges
like the Rockies, which extend over 3,000 miles. Soon after, the Eurasian Plate rifts
from North America, opening the North Atlantic Ocean. We'll fast forward again. The Colorado Plateau now uplifts, likely due to a combination
of upward mantle flow and a thickened North American Plate. In future millennia, the Colorado River
will eventually sculpt the plateau into the epic Grand Canyon. 30 million years ago, the majority of
the Farallon Plate sinks into the mantle, leaving behind only small corners 
still subducting. The Pacific 
and North American plates converge and a new boundary 
called the San Andreas Fault forms. Here, North America moves to the south, sliding against the Pacific Plate,
which shifts to the north. This plate boundary still exists today, and moves about 30 millimeters per year capable of causing 
devastating earthquakes. The San Andreas also pulls apart
western North America across a wide rift zone. This extensional region is called
the Basin and Range Province, and through uplift and erosion, is responsible for exposing the once deep
granite of Yosemite and the Sierra Nevada. Another 15 million years off the clock, and magma from the mantle burns
a giant hole into western North America, periodically erupting onto the surface. Today, this hotspot feeds 
an active supervolcano beneath Yellowstone National Park. It hasn't erupted 
in the last 174,000 years, but if it did, its sheer force could blanket
most of the continent with ash that would blacken the skies
and threaten humanity. The Yellowstone supervolcano
is just one reminder that the Earth continues 
to seethe below our feet. Its mobile plates put the planet
in a state of constant flux. In another few hundred million years, who knows how the landscape
of North America will have changed. As the continent slowly morphs
into something unfamiliar, only geological time will tell.","North America's shape has evolved over 750 million years. The continent, once part of Rodinia, rifted and formed the Panthalassa Ocean. Laurentia, an ancestral continent, grew as island chains collided with it. The Iapetus Ocean closed, causing the African plate to collide with Laurentia, forming Pangea.

top predators, such as the alligator and panther, causing a significant reduction
in their food sources. They're not a problem
in their native Asia because diseases, parasites, and predators
help to control their population size. And in Australia, European rabbits
eat so many plants that they wipe out the food supply
for themselves and other herbivores. They're a pretty recent addition, intentionally introduced to the continent
because one man enjoyed hunting them. Like the Burmese pythons, various factors in their native habitat
keep their numbers in control. But in Australia, the lack of predators and a climate perfect 
for year-long reproduction allows their populations to skyrocket. So why does this keep happening? Most of the world's ecosystems are the result of millennia 
of coevolution by organisms, adapting to their environment 
and each other until a stable balance is reached. Healthy ecosystems maintain this balance
via limiting factors, environmental conditions that restrict
the size or range of a species. These include things 
like natural geography and climate, food availability, and the presence or absence of predators. For example, plant growth depends
on levels of sunlight and soil nutrients. The amount of edible plants affects
the population of herbivores, which in turn impacts the carnivores
that feed on them. And a healthy predator population keeps
the herbivores from becoming too numerous and devouring all the plants. But even minor changes in one factor
can upset this balance, and the sudden introduction
of non-native organisms can be a pretty major change. A species that is evolved
in a separate habitat will be susceptible to different 
limiting factors, different predators, different energy sources, and different climates. If the new habitat's limiting factors
fail to restrict the species growth, it will continue to multiply, out-competing native organisms
for resources and disrupting the entire ecosystem. Species are sometimes introduced
into new habitats through natural factors, like storms, ocean currents, or climate shifts. The majority of invasive species,
though, are introduced by humans. Often this happens unintentionally, as when the zebra mussel was accidentally
brought to Lake Erie by cargo ships. But as people migrate around the world, we have also deliberately brought
our plants and animals along, rarely considering the consequences. But now that we're learning more about the effects of invasive species
on ecosystems, many governments closely monitor
the transport of plants and animals, and ban the imports of certain organisms. But could the species with
the most drastic environmental impact be a group of primates who emerged
from Africa to cover most of the world? Are we an invasive species?","Invasive species are organisms that become harmful due to their location. The kudzu vine, Burmese pythons, and European rabbits are examples of invasive species that have caused destruction in their new habitats. This happens because the new habitat lacks the limiting factors that control their population in their native habitat. Most invasive species are introduced by humans, either intentionally or unintentionally. Governments are now taking measures to prevent the introduction of invasive species by monitoring the transport of plants and animals and banning certain imports. The video ends by asking if humans, who have migrated from Africa and covered most of the world, could be considered an invasive species."
28,28,xOXSqy05EO0,Can plants talk to each other? - Richard Karban,"Can plants talk to each other? It certainly doesn't seem that way. Plants don't have complex sensory
or nervous systems like animals do, and they look pretty passive, basking in the sun, and responding instinctively
to inputs like light and water. But odd as it sounds, 
plants can communicate with each other. Just like animals, plants produce 
all kinds of chemical signals in response to their environments, and they can share those signals
with each other, especially when they're under attack. These signals take two routes: through the air, and through the soil. When plant leaves get damaged, whether by hungry insects
or an invading lawn mower, they release plumes
of volatile chemicals. They're what's responsible for the smell
of freshly cut grass. Certain kinds of plants, 
like sagebrush and lima beans, are able to pick up on those
airborne messages and adjust their 
own internal chemistry accordingly. In one experiment, sagebrush leaves
were deliberately damaged by insects or scissor-wielding scientists. Throughout the summer, other branches on the same sagebrush plant got eaten less 
by insects wandering through, and so did branches on neighboring bushes, suggesting that they had beefed up
their anti-insect defenses. Even moving the air from above
a clipped plant to another one made the second plant 
more insect-resistant. These airborne cues increase 
the likelihood of seedling survival, and made adult plants produce
more new branches and flowers. But why would a plant warn
its neighbors of danger, especially if they're competing 
for resources? Well, it might be an accidental 
consequence of a self-defense mechanism. Plants can't move information through
their bodies as easily as we can, especially if water is scarce. So plants may rely 
on those airborne chemicals to get messages from 
one part of a plant to another. Nearby plants can eavesdrop 
on those signals, like overhearing your neighbor sneeze
and stocking up on cold medicine. Different plants convey those warnings
using different chemical languages. Individual sagebrush plants 
in the same meadow release slightly different sets
of alarm chemicals. The makeup of that cocktail influences
the effectiveness of communication. The more similar 
two plants' chemical fingerprints are, the more fluently they can communicate. A plant will be most sensitive to the cues
emitted by its own leaves. But because these chemicals seem
to be inherited, like human blood types, sagebrush plants communicate 
more effectively with relatives than with strangers. But sometimes, even other species
can benefit. Tomato and tobacco plants can both
decipher sagebrush warning signals. Plants don't have to rely solely
on those airborne broadcasts. Signals can travel 
below the soil surface, too. Most plants have a symbiotic relationship
with fungi, which colonize the plants' roots
and help them absorb water and nutrients. These fungal filaments 
form extensive networks that can connect separate plants, creating an underground super highway
for chemical messages. When a tomato plant responds to blight by acitvating disease-fighting 
genes and enzymes, signaling molecules produced
by its immune system can travel to a healthy plant and prompt it to turn on
its immune system, too. These advance warnings increase
the plants chance of survival. Bean plants also eavesdrop
on each other's health through these fungal conduits. An aphid investation in one plant triggers its neighbor to ramp up
production of compounds that repel aphids and attract aphid-eating wasps. If you think of communication
as an exchange of information, then plants seem to be 
active communicators. They're sending, receiving, 
and responding to signals without making a sound, and without brains, noses, dictionaries,
or the Internet. And if we can learn to speak to them
on their terms, we may gain a powerful new tool to protect
crops and other valuable species. It all makes you wonder 
what else are we missing?","Plants can communicate with each other through chemical signals, both in the air and underground. When a plant is damaged, it releases volatile chemicals that can be detected by other plants, which then adjust their internal chemistry accordingly. This can increase their resistance to insects and help them survive better. Plants can also communicate through fungi that colonize their roots, forming extensive networks that can connect separate plants and allow them to exchange chemical signals. This communication can help plants prepare for diseases and pests, and if we can learn to understand it, we could gain a powerful new tool to protect crops and other valuable species."
29,29,sI8NsYIyQ2A,Why do cats act so weird? - Tony Buffington,"Why do cats do that? They're cute, they're lovable, and judging by the 26 billions views
of over 2 million YouTube videos of them pouncing, bouncing, climbing, cramming, stalking, clawing, chattering, and purring, one thing is certain: cats are very entertaining. These somewhat strange feline behaviors, both amusing and baffling, leave many of us asking,
""Why do cats do that?"" Throughout time, cats were simultaneously
solitary predators of smaller animals and prey for larger carnivores. As both predator and prey, survival of their species depended
on crucial instinctual behaviors which we still observe in wild 
and domestic cats today. While the feline actions of your house cat
Grizmo might seem perplexing, in the wild, these same behaviors, naturally bred into cats 
for millions of years, would make Grizmo a super cat. Enabled by their unique muscular structure
and keen balancing abilities, cats climbed to high vantage points
to survey their territory and spot prey in the wild. Grizmo doesn't need these particular
skills to find and hunt down dinner in her food bowl today, but instinctually, viewing the living room
from the top of the bookcase is exactly what she has evolved to do. As wild predators, cats are opportunistic
and hunt whenever prey is available. Since most cat prey are small, cats in the wild needed to eat 
many times each day, and use a stalk, pounce, kill, eat
strategy to stay fed. This is why Grizmo prefers to chase
and pounce on little toys and eat small meals over the course
of the day and night. Also, small prey tend to hide in tiny
spaces in their natural environments, so one explanation for Grizmo's propensity
to reach into containers and openings is that she is compelled by 
the same curiosity that helped ensure the continuation of
her species for millions of years before. In the wild, cats needed sharp claws
for climbing, hunting, and self-defense. Sharpening their claws on nearby surfaces
kept them conditioned and ready, helped stretch their back and leg muscles, and relieve some stress, too. So, it's not that Grizmo hates your couch, chair, ottoman, pillows, curtains, and everything else 
you put in her environment. She's ripping these things to shreds
and keeping her claws in tip-top shape because this is exactly what her ancestors
did in order to survive. As animals that were preyed upon, cats evolved to not get caught, and in the wild, the cats that were 
the best at avoiding predators thrived. So at your house today, Grizmo is an expert 
at squeezing into small spaces and seeking out and hiding
in unconventional spots. It also explains why she prefers
a clean and odor-free litter box. That's less likely to give away 
her location to any predators that may be sniffing around nearby. Considering everything 
we do know about cats, it seems that one of their most 
predominate behaviors is still one of the most mysterious. Cats may purr for any number of reasons, such as happiness, stress, and hunger. But curiously, 
the frequency of their purrs, between 25 and 150 hertz, is within a range that can promote
tissue regeneration. So while her purring makes Grizmo
an excellent nap companion, it is also possible that her purr
is healing her muscles and bones, and maybe even yours, too. They developed through time as both solitary predators 
that hunted and killed to eat, and stealthy prey that hid
and escaped to survive. So cats today retain many 
of the same instincts that allowed them to thrive in the wild
for millions of years. This explains some of their seemingly
strange behaviors. To them, our homes are their jungles. But if this is the case, 
in our own cat's eyes, who are we? Big, dumb, hairless cats competing with
them for resources? Terribly stupid predators they're able
to outsmart every day? Or maybe they think we're the prey.","Cats are fascinating creatures with many strange behaviors that can be explained by their evolution as both predators and prey. Their climbing, stalking, pouncing, and clawing instincts come from their wild ancestors. Cats purr at a frequency that can promote tissue regeneration. They are still hunters and need to eat small meals throughout the day and night. Cats are also very clean animals and prefer a clean litter box. They like to squeeze into small spaces and hide in unconventional spots for safety. Cats view our homes as their jungles and may see us as big, dumb, hairless cats, stupid predators, or even prey."
30,30,uy9GFAOGGXU,Why is Mount Everest so tall? - Michele Koppes,"Every spring, hundreds of adventure-seekers dream
of climbing Qomolangma, also known as Mount Everest. At base camp, they hunker down for months waiting for the chance to scale 
the mountain's lofty, lethal peak. But why do people risk life and limb
to climb Everest? Is it the challenge? The view? The chance to touch the sky? For many, the draw is Everest's status
as the highest mountain on Earth. There's an important distinction
to make here. Mauna Kea is actually the tallest
from base to summit, but at 8850 meters above sea level, Everest has the highest altitude 
on the planet. To understand how 
this towering formation was born, we have to peer deep 
into our planet's crust, where continental plates collide. The Earth's surface 
is like an armadillo's armor. Pieces of crust constantly move over, under, and around each other. For such huge continental plates,
the motion is relatively quick. They move two to four 
centimeters per year, about as fast as fingernails grow. When two plates collide, one pushes into or underneath the other,
buckling at the margins, and causing what's known as uplift
to accomodate the extra crust. That's how Everest came about. 50 million years ago, the Earth's 
Indian Plate drifted north, bumped into the bigger Eurasian Plate, and the crust crumpled,
creating huge uplift. Mountain Everest lies at the heart
of this action, on the edge of the Indian-Eurasian 
collision zone. But mountains are shaped by forces
other than uplift. As the land is pushed up, 
air masses are forced to rise as well. Rising air cools, causing any water
vapor within it to condense and form rain or snow. As that falls, 
it wears down the landscape, dissolving rocks or breaking them down
in a process known as weathering. Water moving downhill carries
the weathered material and erodes the landscape, carving out deep valleys and jagged peaks. This balance between uplift and erosion
gives a mountain its shape. But compare the celestial peaks
of the Himalayas to the comforting hills of Appalachia. Clearly, all mountains are not alike. That's because time 
comes into the equation, too. When continental plates first collide,
uplift happens fast. The peaks grow tall with steep slopes. Over time, however, gravity and water
wear them down. Eventually, erosion overtakes uplift, wearing down peaks 
faster than they're pushed up. A third factor shapes mountains: climate. In subzero temperatures, some snowfall
doesn't completely melt away, instead slowly compacting 
until it becomes ice. That forms the snowline, which occurs
at different heights around the planet depending on climate. At the freezing poles,
the snowline is at sea level. Near the equator, you have to climb
five kilometers before it gets cold enough for ice to form. Gathered ice starts flowing under
its own immense weight forming a slow-moving frozen river
known as a glacier, which grinds the rocks below. The steeper the mountains, 
the faster ice flows, and the quicker it carves 
the underlying rock. Glaciers can erode landscapes
swifter than rain and rivers. Where glaciers cling to mountain peaks,
they sand them down so fast, they lop the tops off
like giant snowy buzzsaws. So then, how did the icy Mount Everest
come to be so tall? The cataclysmic continental clash
from which it arose made it huge to begin with. Secondly, the mountain lies 
near the tropics, so the snowline is high,
and the glaciers relatively small, barely big enough to widdle it down. The mountain exists in a perfect storm
of conditions that maintain its impressive stature. But that won't always be the case. We live in a changing world 
where the continental plates, Earth's climate, and the planet's erosive power might one day conspire to cut 
Mount Everest down to size. For now, at least, it remains legendary
in the minds of hikers, adventurers, and dreamers alike.","Mount Everest is the highest mountain on Earth, standing at 8850 meters above sea level. It was formed 50 million years ago when the Indian Plate collided with the Eurasian Plate, causing the crust to crumple and uplift. The mountain's height is due to the balance between uplift and erosion, which shapes its peaks. The snowline, which is the height at which snowfall doesn't completely melt away, is high on Mount Everest because it is near the tropics. The glaciers on the mountain are relatively small, so they don't erode it as quickly as other mountains. However, the mountain's impressive stature may not last forever, as the continental plates, Earth's climate, and erosive power may one day conspire to cut it down to size.

31,31,dkP8NUwB2io,How do schools of fish swim in harmony? - Nathan S. Jacobs,"How do schools of fish swim in harmony? And how do the tiny cells in your brain
give rise to the complex thoughts, memories, and consciousness that are you? Oddly enough, those questions have
the same general answer: emergence, or the spontaneous creation of
sophisticated behaviors and functions from large groups of simple elements. Like many animals, 
fish stick together in groups, but that's not just because
they enjoy each other's company. It's a matter of survival. Schools of fish exhibit 
complex swarming behaviors that help them evade hungry predators, while a lone fish is quickly singled out
as easy prey. So which brilliant fish leader
is the one in charge? Actually, no one is, and everyone is. So what does that mean? While the school of fish is elegantly
twisting, turning, and dodging sharks in what looks 
like deliberate coordination, each individual fish is actually
just following two basic rules that have nothing to do with the shark: one, stay close, but not too close
to your neighbor, and two, keep swimmming. As individuals, the fish are focused on
the minutiae of these local interactions, but if enough fish join the group,
something remarkable happens. The movement of individual fish 
is eclipsed by an entirely new entity: the school, which has its own
unique set of behaviors. The school isn't controlled
by any single fish. It simply emerges if you have enough fish
following the right set of local rules. It's like an accident that happens over
and over again, allowing fish all across the ocean
to reliably avoid predation. And it's not just fish. Emergence is a basic property of many
complex systems of interacting elements. For example, the specific way in which
millions of grains of sand collide and tumble over each other almost always produces the same
basic pattern of ripples. And when moisture freezes
in the atmosphere, the specific binding properties
of water molecules reliably produce radiating lattices
that form into beautiful snowflakes. What makes emergence so complex is that you can't understand it
by simply taking it apart, like the engine of a car. Taking things apart is a good first step
to understanding a complex system. But if you reduce a school of fish
to individuals, it loses the ability to evade predators, and there's nothing left to study. And if you reduce the brain 
to individual neurons, you're left with something that is
notoriously unreliable, and nothing like how we think and behave, at least most of the time. Regardless, whatever you're thinking about
right now isn't reliant on a single neuron
lodged in the corner of your brain. Rather, the mind emerges from
the collective activities of many, many neurons. There are billions of neurons 
in the human brain, and trillions of connections between
all those neurons. When you turn such a complicated
system like that on, it could behave in all sorts
of weird ways, but it doesn't. The neurons in our brain follow
simple rules, just like the fish, so that as a group, their activity
self-organizes into reliable patterns that let you do things 
like recognize faces, successfully repeat the same task
over and over again, and keep all those silly little habits
that everyone likes about you. So, what are the simple rules 
when it comes to the brain? The basic function of each neuron
in the brain is to either excite or inhibit
other neurons. If you connect a few neurons together
into a simple circuit, you can generate rhythmic patterns
of activity, feedback loops that ramp up
or shut down a signal, coincidence detectors, and disinhibition, where two inhibitory neurons
can actually activate another neuron by removing inhibitory brakes. As more and more neurons are connected, increasingly complex patterns 
of activity emerge from the network. Soon, so many neurons are interacting
in so many different ways at once that the system becomes chaotic. The trajectory of the network's activity
cannot be easily explained by the simple local circuits
described earlier. And yet, from this chaos,
patterns can emerge, and then emerge again and again
in a reproducible manner. At some point, these emergent
patterns of activity become sufficiently complex, and curious to begin studying
their own biological origins, not to mention emergence. And what we found in emergent phenomena
at vastly different scales is that same remarkable
characteristic as the fish displayed: That emergence doesn't require
someone or something to be in charge. If the right rules are in place, and some basic conditions are met, a complex system will fall into
the same habits over and over again, turning chaos into order. That's true in the molecular pandemonium
that lets your cells function, the tangled thicket of neurons
that produces your thoughts and identity, your network of friends and family, all the way up to the structures and
economies of our cities across the planet.","Fish swim in schools to avoid predators, following two basic rules: stay close, but not too close to your neighbor, and keep swimming.

32,32,2ivZ6GSaK1M,Why are there so many insects? - Murry Gans,"If insects suddenly morphed
into large beings, and decided to wage war on us, there's no doubt that humans
would lose. We'd simply be crushed 
by their sheer numbers. There are an estimated 10 quintillion
individual insects on Earth. That's a one followed by 19 zeroes. So, compared with our population
of about 7 billion, these invertebrates outnumber
us by more than a billion to one. Their astounding numbers exist
at the species level, as well. There are more than 60,000
vertebrate species on the planet. But the class of insects contains
a million known species, and many others 
that haven't been classified. In fact, these critters make up 
approximately 75% of all animals on Earth. So, what's their secret to success? Insect abundance comes down
to many things that together make them some of the most
adaptable and resilient creatures, beginning with their impressive 
ability to breed. Many species can produce hundreds
of offspring within their lifetimes. Most offspring will die, but more than enough will survive
into adulthood to reproduce. Offspring also mature very rapidly, so the cycle of reproduction
resumes quickly, and can occur over and over again
in a short time. These numbers mean that as a class, insects harbor a tremendous amount
of genetic diversity. The different species contain
a wealth of genetic data that give them the necessary adaptations
they need to thrive in a range of environments
across the planet. Even some of the most extreme
environments are in bounds; Flat bark beetles can live at
-40 degrees Fahrenheit, Sahara Desert ants can venture out when surface temperatures exceed
155 degrees, and some bumblebees can survive
18,000 feet above sea level. Insect exoskeletons also work
like body armor, protecting insects against
the outside world and helping them cope with habitats
that other creatures can't. Even their small size, which we might see as a disadvantage, is something they use to their benefit. Because most species are so tiny, millions of insects can inhabit
a small space and make use of all the available
resources within it. This means they can occupy hundreds
of different niches across ecosystems. Some insects survive by eating the roots, stems, leaves, seeds, pollen, and nectar of specific plants. Others, like wasps, make use of live insects 
by paralyzing the victims and laying their eggs inside so that when the hatchlings emerge, they can eat their way out
and get nourishment. Mosquitos and biting flies feed on blood, taking advantage of this unusual resource
to ensure their survival. And a whole bunch of other insects
have built a niche around feces. Flies lay their eggs there, and some beetles even build
large balls out of animal dung, which they eat and use as accommodation
for their eggs. And then there's the insects' mighty power
of metamorphosis. This trait not only transforms insects, but also helps them maximize
the available resources in an ecosystem. Take butterflies. In their larval caterpillar form, they chomp hungrily through leaves
at a rapid rate to help them grow and spin cocoons. But when they emerge as butterflies, these insects feed only on flower nectar. Metamorphosis means the larvae
and adults of one species will never compete for the same resource, so they successfully share 
an ecological niche without limiting their own success. This process is so efficient that an incredible 86% of insect species
undergo complete metamorphosis. We're big and they're small, so it's easy to forget that these critters
are moving in their millions all around us, all the time. But examine almost any patch of ground, and you're sure to find them there. Their numbers are immense,
and their success is unmatched. We may have to accept 
that it's insects, not us, that are the true conquerors 
of the planet.","Insects are incredibly abundant, with an estimated 10 quintillion individuals on Earth. They make up 75% of all animals and have approximately 1 million known species.

Metamorphosis enables them to maximize resources and share ecological niches without competition. Insects are the true conquerors of the planet, with their sheer numbers and adaptability."
33,33,cNVZEVq3KzY,Why certain naturally occurring wildfires are necessary - Jim Schulz,"There was a time before our ancestors
smashed flint and steel together, when they felt the cold 
lack of fire in their lives. But anthropologists theorize 
that early hominids relied on lightning to cause forest fires, from which they could collect coals
and burning sticks. Fire gave them the ability to cook food
and clear land, and became central in many rituals
and traditions. So instead of seeing forest fires
as an exclusively bad thing, ancient humans may have learned
to appreciate them. Yet, it wasn't just humans who
benefitted from these natural phenomena. Even as they destroy trees,
fires also help the forest themselves, however counterintuitive that seems. In fact, several forest species,
such as select conifers, need fire to survive. But how can fire possibly create life
in addition to destroying it? The answer lies in the way
that certain forests grow. In the conifer-rich forests 
of western North America, lodgepole pines constantly seek the Sun. Their seeds prefer to grow 
on open sunny ground, which pits saplings against each other
as each tries to get more light by growing straighter and faster
than its neighbors. Over time, generations of slender,
lofty lodgepoles form an umbrella-like canopy
that shades the forest floor below. But as the trees' pine cones mature
to release their twirling seeds, this signals a problem
for the lodgepoles' future. Very few of these seeds will germintate
in the cool, sunless shade created by their towering parents. These trees have adapted to this problem
by growing two types of cones. There are the regular annual cones
that release seeds spontaneously, and another type called serotinous cones, which need an environmental trigger
to free their seeds. Serotinous cones 
are produced in thousands, and are like waterproofed time capsules
sealed with resinous pitch. Many are able to stay undamaged
on the tree for decades. Cones that fall to the ground
can be viable for several years, as well. But when temperatures get high enough,
the cones pop open. Let's see that in action. Once it's gotten started,
a coniferous forest fire typically spreads something like this. Flames ravage the thick understory
provided by species like douglas fir, a shade-tolerant tree 
that's able to thrive under the canopy 
of lodgepole pines. The fire uses these smaller trees
as a step ladder to reach the higher canopy 
of old lodgepole pines. That ignites a tremendous crown fire reaching temperatures 
of up to 2400 degrees Fahrenheit. That's well more than the 115-140 degrees that signal the moment 
when serotinous seeds can be freed. At those temperatures,
the cones burst open, releasing millions of seeds, which are carried by the hot air
to form new forests. After the fire, carbon-rich soils
and an open sunlit landscape help lodgepole seeds germinate quickly
and sprout in abundance. From the death of the old forest
comes the birth of the new. Fires are also important
for the wider ecosystem as a whole. Without wildfires to rejuvenate trees,
key forest species would disappear, and so would the many creatures
that depend on them. And if a fire-dependent forest
goes too long without burning, that raises the risk 
of a catastrophic blaze, which could destroy a forest completely, not to mention people's homes and lives. That's why forest rangers sometimes
intentionally start controlled burns to reduce fuels in order to keep
the more dangerous wildfires at bay. They may be frightening
and destructive forces of nature, but wildfires are also vital to the existence of healthy 
boreal forest ecosystems. By coming to terms with that, we can protect ourselves from their
more damaging effects while enabling the forests,
like the legendary phoenix, to rise reborn from their own ashes.","Wildfires are often seen as destructive forces, but they are also necessary for the survival of certain forest species.

Sir Francis Drake sailed across

the nearby Lake Maracaibo, home to a colony of Spanish settlers
he planned to overthrow. But as Drake moved towards the mouth
of the lake under cover of darkness, his plot was suddenly 
and magnificently foiled. Huge flashes of lightning 
illuminated the landscape, exposing the fleet as if it were daytime, which warned the Spanish

at over 13,000 square kilometers is a place of almost perpetual storming. Thunderstorms rage above it
for up to 200 days of the year, each earsplitting event lasting
for several hours. Like everywhere else on Earth, lightning at Lake Maracaibo is the result
of opposing electrical charges that steadily build up 
inside storm clouds. Once there's a large enough difference
between charges either within the cloud or between the clouds
and the Earth below, it forms a spark that becomes
a lightning bolt. Lightning strikes the earth
about 350 million times per year, averaging out to eleven strikes a second. We know that thanks to satellites
up in space and sensors on the ground. We can also measure 
the Earth's lightning density, which is the frequency with which
lightning flashes in a square kilometer. Knowing where lightning strikes
and how often reveals the most 
lightning-rich places on Earth. In the polar regions, there may only be one strike
per several square kilometers each year. Meanwhile, lightning density 
at the equator averages out to tens of flashes
per square kilometer on account of the sun providing
more heat to drive storms. Yet nowhere can quite compare
with Lake Maracaibo, where lightning strikes an average
250 times per square kilometer, giving it the highest lightning density
of any place on Earth. A number of factors converge to create
the lake's seemingly everlasting storms. Firstly, Lake Maracaibo lies just 
ten degrees north of the Equator, so there's a wealth of solar energy
available to fuel the storms. Thunderstorms also require a supply
of water vapor to feed on, and having the warm waters
of the Caribbean so close by provides an endless supply. Finally, the lake's southern 
and western edges are bordered by two massive 
mountain ranges, and as cool winds surge
down these slopes, they force up warm air, destabilizing the atmosphere
and causing storm clouds to form. Together, these ingredients combine to give rise to the most awe-inspiring
thunderstorms on the planet, a true sight to behold. Centuries ago, Sir Francis Drake may have
cursed the lake's intense illumination, but today, sailors actually embrace
this phenomenon. They call it the Maracaibo Beacon, and use it as a natural lighthouse
to illuminate their path across the seas.","Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela is the most lightning-struck place on Earth, with an average of 250 lightning strikes per square kilometer. This is due to its location near the equator, the warm waters of the Caribbean, and the two massive mountain ranges surrounding it. The lake's lightning density is the highest in the world, with storms lasting for up to 200 days a year. The phenomenon, known as the Maracaibo Beacon, was once a problem for Sir Francis Drake but is now used by sailors as a natural lighthouse. Thunderstorms are caused by opposing electrical charges building up inside storm clouds, resulting in a spark that becomes a lightning bolt. Lightning strikes the Earth about 350 million times per year."
35,35,RAdNCIIYXvo,"When will the next mass extinction occur? - Borths, D'Emic, and Pritchard","About 66 million years ago, something terrible happened
to life on our planet. Ecosystems were hit with a double blow as massive volcanic eruptions filled
the atmosphere with carbon dioxide and an asteroid roughly the size
of Manhattan struck the Earth. The dust from the impact reduced or
stopped photosynthesis from many plants, starving herbivores and the carnivores
that preyed on them. Within a short time span, three-quarters of the world's species
disappeared forever, and the giant dinosaurs, flying pterosaurs, shelled squids, and marine reptiles 
that had flourished for ages faded into prehistory. It may seem like the dinosaurs
were especially unlucky, but extinctions of various severities have
occurred throughout the Earth's history, and are still happening 
all around us today. Environments change, pushing some species 
out of their comfort zones while creating new opportunities
for others. Invasive species arrive in new habitats,
outcompeting the natives. And in some cases, 
entire species are wiped out as a result of activity 
by better adapted organisms. Sometimes, however, massive changes
in the environment occur too quickly 
for most living creatures to adapt, causing thousands of species to die off
in a geological instant. We call this a mass extinction event, and although such events may be rare, paleontologists have been able 
to identify several of them through dramatic changes 
in the fossil record, where lineages that persisted
through several geological layers suddenly disappear. In fact, these mass extinctions are used
to divide the Earth's history into distinct periods. Although the disappearance 
of the dinosaurs is the best known mass extinction event, the largest occurred long before
dinosaurs ever existed. 252 million years ago,
between the Permian and Triassic periods, the Earth's land masses gathered together
into the single supercontinent Pangaea. As it coalesced, 
its interior was filled with deserts, while the single coastline eliminated
many of the shallow tropical seas where biodiversity thrived. Huge volcanic eruptions 
occurred across Siberia, coinciding with very high temperatures, suggesting a massive greenhouse effect. These catastrophes 
contributed to the extinction of 95% of species in the ocean, and on land, the strange 
reptiles of the Permian gave way to the ancestors of the 
far more familiar dinosaurs we know today. But mass extinctions are not just a thing
of the distant past. Over the last few million years, the fluctuation of massive ice sheets
at our planet's poles has caused sea levels to rise and fall, changing weather patterns
and ocean currents along the way. As the ice sheets spread, 
retreated, and returned, some animals were either 
able to adapt to the changes, or migrate to a more suitable environment. Others, however, 
such as giant ground sloths, giant hyenas, and mammoths went extinct. The extinction of these large mammals coincides with changes in the climate
and ecosystem due to the melting ice caps. But there is also 
an uncomfortable overlap with the rise of a certain hominid species
originating in Africa 150,000 years ago. In the course of their adaptation
to the new environment, creating new tools and methods
for gathering food and hunting prey, humans may not have single-handedly caused
the extinction of these large animals, as some were able to coexist with us
for thousands of years. But it's clear that today, our tools and methods 
have become so effective that humans are no longer reacting
to the environment, but are actively changing it. The extinction of species 
is a normal occurrence in the background of ecosystems. But studies suggest 
that rates of extinction today for many organisms are hundreds to thousands of times higher
than the normal background. But the same unique ability that makes
humans capable of driving mass extinctions can also enable us to prevent them. By learning about past extinction events, recognizing what is happening today
as environments change, and using this knowledge to lessen
our effect on other species, we can transform humanity's impact
on the world from something as destructive
as a massive asteroid into a collaborative part
of a biologically diverse future.","Mass extinctions have happened throughout Earth's history, including the most famous one 66 million years ago that wiped out the dinosaurs. The largest mass extinction occurred 252 million years ago, where 95% of species in the ocean and on land disappeared.

36,36,qYijAZWdnBk,How do we know what color dinosaurs were? - Len Bloch,"This is the microraptor, a carnivorous four-winged dinosaur
that was almost two-feet long, ate fish, and lived about 120 million years ago. Most of what we know about it
comes from fossils that look like this. So, is its coloration here 
just an artist's best guess? The answer is no. We know this shimmering 
black color is accurate because paleontologists have analyzed
clues contained within the fossil. But making sense of the evidence
requires careful examination of the fossil and a good understanding of the physics
of light and color. First of all, here's what we actually see
on the fossil: imprints of bones and feathers that have
left telltale mineral deposits. And from those imprints, we can determine that these 
microraptor feathers were similar to modern dinosaur,
as in bird, feathers. But what gives birds their signature
diverse colorations? Most feathers contain just one
or two dye-like pigments. The cardinal's bright red
comes from carotenoids, the same pigments 
that make carrots orange, while the black of its face
is from melanin, the pigment that colors our hair and skin. But in bird feathers,
melanin isn't simply a dye. It forms hollow nanostructures
called melanosomes which can shine in all the colors
of the rainbow. To understand how that works, it helps to remember 
some things about light. Light is basically a tiny electromagnetic
wave traveling through space. The top of a wave is called its crest and the distance between two crests
is called the wavelength. The crests in red light are about
700 billionths of a meter apart and the wavelength of purple light
is even shorter, about 400 billionths of a meter,
or 400 nanometers. When light hits the thin front surface
of a bird's hollow melanosome, some is reflected and some passes through. A portion of the transmitted light
then reflects off the back surface. The two reflected waves interact. Usually they cancel each other out, but when the wavelength
of the reflected light matches the distance between
the two reflections, they reinforce each other. Green light has a wavelength
of about 500 nanometers, so melanosomes that are 
about 500 nanometers across give off green light, thinner melanosomes give off purple light, and thicker ones give off red light. Of course, it's more complex than this. The melanosomes are packed together
inside cells, and other factors, like how the melanosomes are arranged 
within the feather, also matter. Let's return to the microraptor fossil. When scientists examined its feather 
imprints under a powerful microscope, they found nanostructures 
that look like melanosomes. X-ray analysis of the melanosomes
further supported that theory. They contained minerals that would
result from the decay of melanin. The scientists then chose 20 feathers
from one fossil and found that 
the melanosomes in all 20 looked alike, so they became pretty sure this dinosaur
was one solid color. They compared these microraptor
melanosomes to those of modern birds and found a close similarity,
though not a perfect match, to the iridescent teal feathers
found on duck wings. And by examining the exact size
and arrangement of the melanosomes, scientists determined that the feathers
were iridescent black. Now that we can determine
a fossilized feather's color, paleontologists are looking for more
fossils with well-preserved melanosomes. They've found that a lot of dinosaurs,
including velociraptor, probably had feathers, meaning that certain films might not be
so biologically accurate. Clever girls.","The video explains how scientists determine the color of dinosaurs using fossils and the physics of light and color.

37,37,FwGH4gulLX4,The science of snowflakes - Maruša Bradač,"If you ever find yourself 
gazing at falling snow, why not catch a few snowflakes 
on your glove and examine their shapes? You might notice 
that they look symmetrical, and if you look closely, you'll see they have six sides. You could say a snowflake 
is simply frozen water, but compare one 
with an ice cube from the freezer, and you'll realize 
they're very different things. Unlike ice cubes, formed when liquid
freezes into a solid, snowflakes form when water vapor
turns straight into ice. But that still doesn't explain why
snowflakes have six sides. To understand that, we need to delve deeper 
into the physics of water. Water is made out of two hydrogen atoms
and one oxygen atom. A single water molecule 
thus has ten protons and ten electrons, eight from oxygen 
and one from each hydrogen atom. The two electrons 
from oxygen's outer shell are shared with two electrons
from both hydrogens as they bond together, and the remaining 
four outer shell electrons from oxygen form two pairs. We call the bonds between these atoms
covalent bonds. The pairs of electrons 
are all negatively charged. Similar charges repel, so they tend to stay as far away
from each other as possible. The pairs form four electron clouds, two of which are where the hydrogen
and oxygen share electrons. The repulsion between the unbonded pairs is even stronger than repulsion
between the shared pairs, so the two hydrogens 
get pushed a little further to an angle of 104.5 degrees. The water molecule as a whole
is electrically neutral, but oxygen gets 
a larger share of electrons, making it slightly negative
and the hydrogens slightly positive. Due to its negative charge, the oxygen in one molecule is attracted to the positive charge
of the hydrogen in another molecule. And so a weak bond 
between the two molecules, called a hydrogen bond,
is formed. When water freezes, this bonding
occurs on repeat, ultimately forming a hexagonal structure due to the angle between hydrogens
and oxygen within each molecule. This is the seed of a snowflake, and it retains a hexagonal shape
as it grows. As the snowflake moves through the air, water vapor molecules 
stick to the six sharp edges and expand the snowflake outwards,
bit by bit. A snowflake's developing shape depends
on atmospheric conditions, like humidity and temperature. As a snowflake falls, changes in weather conditions
can affect how it grows, and even small differences in the paths
two snowflakes take will differentiate their shapes. However, since conditions at the six 
sharp edges of one snowflake are similar, a symmetric snowflake can grow. Weather conditions 
affect snow on the ground, as well. Warmer ground temperatures produce
a wetter snow that is easier to pack because liquid water molecules
help snowflakes stick to each other. Melted snow also plays a critical role
in another wintry activity, skiing. Completely dry snow 
is very difficult to ski on because there's too much friction between
the jagged snowflakes and the ski surface. So what's happening is that as skis move, they rub the surface of the snow
and warm it up, creating a thin layer of water,
which helps them slide along. So technically, 
it's not really snow skiing, but water skiing. But it is true that 
no matter how hard you look, you're almost definitely not going to find
two identical snowflakes, and that's a mystery that scientists
are still trying to solve, though we know that it has to do with the many possible 
branching points in snowflake formation, and the differences 
in temperature and humidity, and while we wait for the answer, we can enjoy watching these tiny fractals
falling from the sky.","Snowflakes are not just frozen water, but a unique structure formed by water vapor turning into ice. They have six sides due to the angle between hydrogen and oxygen in a water molecule, which forms a hexagonal structure when freezing.

Warmer ground temperatures produce wetter snow, which is easier to pack and helps skis slide along due to the thin layer of water created by friction.

38,38,_1FY5kL_zXU,Do animals have language? - Michele Bishop,"All animals communicate. Crabs wave their claws at each other
to signal that they're healthy and ready to mate. Cuttlefish use pigmented skin cells
called chromatophores to create patterns on their skin
that act as camouflage or warnings to rivals. Honeybees perform complex dances to let other bees know the location
and quality of a food source. All of these animals have impressive
communication systems, but do they have language? To answer that question, we can look at four specific qualities
that are often associated with language: discreteness, grammar, productivity, and displacement. Discreteness means that there is a set
of individual units, such as sounds or words, that can be combined
to communicate new ideas, like a set of refrigerator poetry magnets
you can rearrange to create different phrases. Grammar provides a system of rules that tells you how to combine 
those individual units. Productivity is the ability 
to use language to create an infinite number of messages. And displacement is the ability 
to talk about things that aren't right in front of you, such as past, future, or fictional events. So, does animal communication exhibit 
any of these qualities? For crabs and cuttlefish, 
the answer is no. They don't combine their signals 
in creative ways. Those signals also don't have to be 
in a grammatical order, and they only communicate 
current conditions, like, ""I am healthy,"" 
or ""I am poisonous."" But some animals actually do display
some of these properties. Bees use the moves, angle, duration,
and intensity of their waggle dance to describe the location and richness
of a food source. That source is outside the hive, so they exhibit the property 
of displacement. They share that language trait
with prairie dogs, which live in towns of thousands, and are hunted by coyotes, hawks,
badgers, snakes, and humans. Their alarms calls indicate
the predator's size, shape, speed, and, even for human predators,
what the person is wearing and if he's carrying a gun. Great apes, like chimps and gorillas,
are great communicators, too. Some have even learned 
a modified sign language. A chimpanzee named Washoe
demonstrated discreteness by combining multiple signs
into original phrases, like, ""Please open. Hurry."" Coco, a female gorilla who understands
more than 1000 signs, and around 2000 words of spoken English referred to a beloved kitten 
that had died. In doing so, she displayed displacement, though it's worth noting that the apes
in both of these examples were using a human communication system, not one that appeared 
naturally in the wild. There are many other examples
of sophisticated animal communication, such as in dolphins, which use whistles to identify age, 
location, names, and gender. They can also understand some grammar in a gestural language researchers use
to communicate with them. However, grammar is not seen 
in the dolphin's natural communication. While these communication systems may have some of the qualities 
of language we've identified, none display all four. Even Washoe and Coco's impressive 
abilities are still outpaced by the language skills 
of most three-year-old humans. And animals' topics of conversation
are usually limited. Bees talk about food, prairie dogs talk about predators, and crabs talk about themselves. Human language stands alone due to the powerful combination
of grammar and productivity, on top of discreteness and displacement. The human brain can take 
a finite number of elements and create an infinite number of messages. We can craft and understand 
complex sentences, as well as words that have never
been spoken before. We can use language to communicate
about an endless range of subjects, talk about imaginary things, and even lie. Research continues to reveal more
and more about animal communication. It may turn out that human language
and animal communication aren't entirely different
but exist on a continuum. After all, we are all animals.","Animals communicate in various ways, but do they have language?

39,39,05PpTqtGhGU,How smart are dolphins? - Lori Marino,"In 1985, three researchers on 
a dolphin-studying expedition got a little bored. To lighten things up, one pretended
to be Poseidon by placing a seaweed garland on his head
and then throwing it into the ocean. Moments later, a dolphin surfaced
with the seaweed crowning her head. Sure, this could have been a coincidence, but it's also entirely possible that
the dolphin was mimicking the scientist. That's because dolphins are one
of the smartest animals species on Earth. So exactly how smart are they? Like whales and porpoises, dolphins belong to the group
of aquatic mammals known as cetaceans
who comprise 86 different species, and share a common link with ungulates,
or hoofed animals. Originally land mammals, the first cetaceans entered the water
about 55 million years ago as large predators with sharp teeth. Then, a shift in ocean temperatures
about 35 million years ago reduced the availability of prey. One group of cetaceans who survived
this distruption, the odontocetes, wound up smaller
with less sharp teeth, but also larger and more complex brains that allowed for complex 
social relationships, as well as echolocation to navigate
and communicate. Jump ahead to the present, and modern dolphins' brains are so large
that their encephalization quotient, their brain size compared to the average
for their body size, is second only to humans. Dolphins have evolved to survive through their ability to form 
complex social networks that hunt, ward off rivals,
and raise offspring together. For example, one group of Florida dolphins practices a sophisticated form
of cooperation to hunt fish. A dolphin designated 
as ""the net-maker"" kicks up mud while another gives the signal for the other dolphins to simultaneously
line up and catch the escaping fish. Achieving a goal like this requires
deliberate planning and cooperation, which, in turn, requires some form
of intentional communication. Dolphins pass down their communication
methods and other skills from generation to generation. Different dolphin populations exhibit
variations in greetings, hunting strategies,
and other behaviors. This sort of cultural transmission
even extends to tool use. One group of bottlenose dolphins
off the Australian coast nicknamed The Dolphin Sponge Club, has learned how to cover their rostrums
with sponges when rooting in sharp corals, passing the knowledge 
from mother to daughter. Dolphins have even demonstrated
language comprehension. When taught a language based on
whistles and hand gestures, they not only understood
what the signals meant, but that their order had meaning: the difference between 
bringing the ball to the hoop and bringing the hoop to the ball. So they were able to process two
of the main elements of human language: symbols that stand 
for objects and actions, and syntax that governs 
how they are structured. Dolphins are also one of the few species
who pass the mirror test. By recognizing themselves in mirrors,
they indicate physical self-awareness, and research shows they can recognize
not just their bodies, but also their own thoughts,
a property called metacognition. In one study, 
dolphins comparing two sounds could indicate a same, different,
or uncertain response. Just like humans, they indicated uncertainty
more often with difficult trials, suggesting they're aware 
of what they know, and how confident they feel
about that knowledge. But some of the most amazing things
about dolphins are their senses of empathy, altruism,
and attachment. The habit of helping injured individuals
extends across the species barrier as evidenced by the many accounts of dolphins carrying humans
to the surface to breathe. And like us, dolphins mourn their dead. When we consider all the evidence, we may wonder why humans still hunt
dolphins for meat, endanger them through fishing
and pollution, or imprison them to perform tricks. The ultimate question may not be
whether dolphins are intelligent and complex beings, but whether humans can empathize with them
enough to keep them safe and free.","Dolphins are one of the smartest animals on Earth, with large brains and complex social networks.

40,40,PddQvyiBfdc,What happens when continents collide? - Juan D. Carrillo,"Tens of millions of years ago, a force of nature set two giant masses
on an unavoidable collision course that would change the face of the Earth and spell life or death 
for thousands of species. The force of nature was plate tectonics, and the bodies were 
North and South America. And even though 
they were hurdling towards each other at an underwhelming 2.5 cm per year, their collision actually did have massive
biological reprocussions by causing one of the greatest episodes of
biological migration in Earth's history: The Great American Biotic Interchange. Our story begins 65 million years ago,
the beginning of the age of mammals, when what is now North and South America were continents separated 
by a marine connection between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. During this time, South America
was the home of fauna that included armored glyptodonts
as large as compact cars, giant ground sloths
weighing more than a ton, opossums, monkeys,
and carnivorous terror birds. North America had its own species, such as horses, bears,
and saber-toothed cats. Over 20 million years, the shifting
of the Farallon and Caribbean Plates produced the Central America Volcanic Arc,
a peninsula connected to North America, with only a very narrow seaway
separating it from South America. As these plates continued
to surf the Earth's magma layer far beneath the Pacific Ocean floor, the Caribbean Plate migrated eastward, and about 15 million years ago, South America finally collided with 
this Central American Arc. This gradually closed the water connection
between the Pacific and the Caribbean, creating a land bridge, which connected North America 
to South America. Terrestrial organisms could now
cross between the two continents, and from the fossil records, it's evident that different waves
of their dispersals took place. Even though plants don't physically move, they are easily dispersed 
by wind and waves, so they migrated first,
along with a few species of birds. They were followed 
by some freshwater fishes and amphibians, and finally, various mammals
began to traverse the bridge. From South America, mammals like
ground sloths and glyptodonts were widly distributed in North America. Moreover, many South American
tropical mammals, like monkeys and bats,
colonized the forests of Central America, and are very abundant today. South American predator marsupials
went extinct 3 million years ago, at which point North American predators,
such as cats, bears and foxes, migrated south and occupied 
the ecological space left behind. Horses, llamas, tapirs, cougars,
saber-toothed cats, gomphotheres, and later humans also headed
south across the land bridge. But what happened on land
is only half the story. What had been one giant ocean
was now two, creating differences in temperature
and salinity for the two bodies of water. The isthmus also became a barrier
for many marine organisms, like mollusks, crustaceans, foraminifera,
bryozoans, and fish, and separated the populations
of many marine species. It also allowed the establishment
of the thermohaline circulation, a global water conveyor belt, which transports warm water
across the Atlantic, and influences the climate
of the East Coast of North America, the West Coast of Europe,
and many other areas. It's a challenge to track all of the ways the collision of the Americas 
changed the world, but it's safe to say that the ripples
of the Great American Biotic Interchange have propagated through
the history of life on the planet, and that of mankind. What if these species hadn't gone extinct, or if there were no monkeys 
in Central America, or jaguars in South America? What if the thermohaline circulation
wasn't flowing? Would the East Coast of North America
be much colder? It all goes to show some of the most
impactful transformations of our planet aren't the explosive ones
that happen in an instant, but the ones that crawl towards
irreversible change. We are the product of history.","Millions of years ago, the collision of North and South America led to the Great American Biotic Interchange, a massive migration of species.

41,41,Pu_ijC8HFRU,How does a jellyfish sting? - Neosha S Kashef,"You're swimming in the ocean
when something brushes your leg. When the tingling sets in, you realize you've been stung 
by a jellyfish. How do these beautiful, gelatinous
creatures pack such a painful punch? Jellyfish are soft 
because they are 95% water and are mostly made of a translucent 
gel-like substance called mesoglea. With such delicate bodies, they rely on thousands of venom-containing
stinging cells called cnidocytes for protection and prey capture. Even baby jellyfish, 
the size of a pencil eraser, have the ability to sting. Larval jellyfish, ephyrae, look like
tiny flowers pulsating in the sea. As they grow, they become umbrella-shaped
with a bell at the top and descending tentacles 
around the margin. The largest species of jellyfish,
the lion's mane, has tentacles that can extend 
more than 100 feet, longer than a blue whale. These tentacles contain 
most of the stinging cells, although some species have them
on their bells, too. Venom is ejected via a nematocyst, a whip-like hollow tubule, which lies coiled under 
high osmotic pressure. When mechanical or chemical stimuli
activate an external trigger, the lid of the cell pops open
and sea water rushes in. This forces a microscopic barbed
harpoon to shoot out, penetrate and inject 
venom into its victim. Nematocyst discharge can occur
in less than a millionth of a second, making it one of nature's fastest
biomechanical processes. Nematocysts can continue
to fire even after a jellyfish has died, so it's important to remove
lingering tentacles stuck to the skin. Rinsing with vinegar will usually render
undischarged nematocysts inactive. Seawater can also help 
remove residual nematocysts. But don't use fresh water
because any change in salt balance alters the osmotic pressure 
outside of the cnidocyte and will trigger the nematocyst to fire. That's why urinating on the affected area,
a common folk remedy, may do more harm that good,
depending on the composition of the urine. Most jellyfish stings 
are a painful nuisance, but some can be deadly. An Indo-Pacific box jelly,
also called a sea wasp, releases venom which can cause
contraction of the heart muscles and rapid death in large doses. There's an anti-venom,
but the venom is fast-acting, so you'd need immediate 
medical intervention. Despite the impressive power
in their tentacles, jellies aren't invincible. Their stinging cells are no match
for the armor of thick-skin predators, like the leatherback turtle
and ocean sunfish. These predators both have adaptations
that prevents slippery jellyfish from escaping after they are engulfed: backwards pointing spines 
in the turtle's mouth and esophagus and recurved teeth 
behind the sunfish's cheeks. Even tiny lobster slipper larvae
can cling to the bell of a jellyfish and hitch a ride, snacking on the jelly while they preserve
their own energy for growth. Small agile fish use the jellies
as moving reefs for protection, darting between tentacles
without ever touching them. Nudibranchs, which are sea slugs
covered in protective slime, can actually steal the jelly's defenses
by eating the cnidocytes and transferring them 
to specialized sacks for later use, as weapons against their own predators. Even humans might benefit
from the sting of a jellyfish one day. Scientists are working on manipulating
cnidocytes to deliver medicine, with nematocysts rarely 3% of the size
of a typical syringe needle. So, the next time you're out 
in the ocean, be careful. But also, take a second 
to marvel at its wonders.","Jellyfish are 95% water and mostly made of a translucent gel-like substance called mesoglea. They have thousands of venom-containing stinging cells called cnidocytes for protection and prey capture. Even baby jellyfish can sting. Larval jellyfish, ephyrae, look like tiny flowers pulsating in the sea. The largest species of jellyfish, the lion's mane, has tentacles that can extend more than 100 feet. Nematocysts can continue to fire even after a jellyfish has died. Rinsing with vinegar will usually render undischarged nematocysts inactive.

42,42,3jIW5wW2WC0,How plants tell time - Dasha Savage,"In the 18th century, Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus
designed the flower clock, a timepiece made of flowering plants that bloom and close 
at specific times of day. Linnaeus's plan wasn't perfect,
but the idea behind it was correct. Flowers can indeed sense time,
after a fashion. Mornings glories unfurl their petals
like clockwork in the early morning. A closing white water lily 
signals that it's late afternoon, and moon flowers, as the name suggests,
only bloom under the night sky. But what gives plants 
this innate sense of time? It's not just plants, in fact. Many organisms on Earth
have a seemingly inherent awareness of where they are in the day's cycle. That's because of circadian rhythms, the internal timekeepers
that tick away inside many living things. These biological clocks allow organisms
to keep track of time and pick up on environmental cues
that help them adapt. That's important, because the planet's
rotations and revolutions put us in a state of constant flux, although it plays out in a repetitive,
predictable way. Circadian rhythms incorporate various cues to regulate when an organism 
should wake and sleep, and perform certain activities. For plants, light and temperature
are the cues which trigger reactions that play out at a molecular scale. The cells in stems, leaves, and flowers
contain phytochromes, tiny molecules that detect light. When that happens, phytochromes
initiate a chain of chemical reactions, passing the message down 
into the cellular nuclei. There, transcription factors trigger
the manufacture of proteins required to carry out 
light-dependent processes, like photosynthesis. These phytochromes not only sense
the amount of light the plant receives, but can also detect tiny differences in the distribution of wavelengths 
the plant takes in. With this fine-tuned sensing, phytochromes allow the plant
to discern both time, the difference between 
the middle of the day and the evening, and place, whether 
it is in direct sunlight or shade, enabling the plant to match
its chemical reactions to its environment. This makes for early risers. A few hours before sunrise,
a typical plant is already active, creating mRNA templates 
for its photosynthesizing machinery. As the phytochromes 
detect increasing sunlight, the plant readies 
its light-capturing molecules so it can photosynthesize
and grow throughout the morning. After harvesting their morning light, plants use the rest of the day
to build long chains of energy in the form of glucose polymers, 
like starch. The sun sets, and the day's work is done, though a plant is anything 
but inactive at night. In the absence of sunlight, they metabolize and grow, breaking down the starch from 
the previous day's energy harvest. Many plants have seasonal rhythms as well. As spring melts the winter frost, phytochromes sense the longer days
and increasing light, and a currently unknown mechanism
detects the temperature change. These systems pass the news
throughout the plant and make it produce blooming flowers in preparation for the pollinators
brought out by warmer weather. Circadian rhythms act as a link
between a plant and its environment. These oscillations come 
from the plants themselves. Each one has a default rhythm. Even so, these clocks 
can adapt their oscillations to environmental changes and cues. On a planet that's in constant flux, it's the circadian rhythms that enable
a plant to stay true to its schedule and to keep its own time.","In the 18th century, Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus designed a flower clock, a timepiece made of flowering plants that bloom and close at specific times of day.

43,43,GK_vRtHJZu4,Why is biodiversity so important? - Kim Preshoff,"Our planet's diverse thriving ecosystems
may seem like permanent fixtures, but they're actually 
vulnerable to collapse. Jungles can become deserts, and reefs can become lifeless rocks, even without cataclysmic events, 
like volcanoes and asteroids. What makes one ecosystem strong
and another weak in the face of change? The answer, to a large extent,
is biodiversity. Biodiversity is built out 
of three intertwined features: ecosystem diversity, species diversity, and genetic diversity. The more intertwining 
there is between these features, the denser and more resilient 
the weave becomes. Take the Amazon rainforest, one of the most biodiverse 
regions on Earth due to its complex ecosystems, huge mix of species, and the genetic variety 
within those species. Here are tangled liana vines, which crawl up from the forest floor 
to the canopy, intertwining with treetops and growing thick wooden stems
that support these towering trees. Helped along by the vines, trees provide the seeds, fruits
and leaves to herbivores, such as the tapir and the agouti, which disperse their seeds
throughout the forest so they can grow. Leftovers are consumed 
by the millions of insects that decompose and recycle nutrients
to create rich soil. The rainforest is a huge system filled
with many smaller systems, like this, each packed with interconnected species. Every link provides stability to the next, strengthening biodiversity's weave. That weave is further reinforced by the genetic diversity 
within individual species, which allows them to cope with changes. Species that lack genetic diversity
due to isolation or low population numbers, are much more vulnerable 
to fluctuations caused by climate change, disease
or habitat fragmentation. Whenever a species disappears
because of its weakened gene pool, a knot is untied 
and parts of the net disintegrate. So, what if we were to remove one species
from the rainforest? Would the system fall apart? Probably not. The volume of species, their genetic diversity, and the complexity of the ecosystems form such rich biodiversity in this forest that one species gap in the weave
won't cause it to unravel. The forest can stay resilient
and recover from change. But that's not true in every case. In some environments, taking away
just one important component can undermine the entire system. Take coral reefs, for instance. Many organisms in a reef
are dependent on the coral. It provides key microhabitats,
shelter and breeding grounds for thousand of species of fish,
crustaceans and mollusks. Corals also form interdependent 
relationships with fungi and bacteria. The coral itself is a loom that allows the tangled net 
of biodiversity to be woven. That makes coral a keystone organism, one that many others depend on
for their suvival. So what happens when destructive
fishing practices, pollution and ocean acidification weaken coral 
or even kill it altogether? Exactly what you might think. The loss of this keystone species
leaves its dependents at a loss, too, threatening the entire fabric of the reef. Ecosystem, species
and genetic diversity together form the complex tangled weave
of biodiversity that is vital for the survival 
of organisms on Earth. We humans are woven 
into this biodiversity, too. When just a few strands are lost, our own well-being is threatened. Cut too many links,
and we risk unraveling it all. What the future brings is unpredictable, but biodiversity can give 
us an insurance policy, Earth's own safety net 
to safeguard our survival.","Biodiversity is crucial for the survival of ecosystems. It's made up of three components: ecosystem diversity, species diversity, and genetic diversity. The more intertwined these features are, the stronger the ecosystem. For example, the Amazon rainforest is highly biodiverse due to its complex ecosystems, variety of species, and genetic diversity within those species. Coral reefs, however, are more vulnerable because they rely on coral as a keystone species, which provides shelter and breeding grounds for many other organisms. When coral is weakened or dies, the entire system is threatened. Humans are also part of this biodiversity, so when species are lost, our well-being is threatened as well. Biodiversity acts as an insurance policy for our survival.

44,44,yc2-363MIQs,The science of static electricity - Anuradha Bhagwat,"It can strike without warning,
at any moment. You may be walking across a soft carpet
and reaching for the door knob when suddenly...zap! To understand static electricity, we first need to know a bit
about the nature of matter. All matter is made up of atoms that consist of three 
types of smaller particles: negatively charged electrons, positively charged protons, and neutral neutrons. Normally, the electrons and protons
in an atom balance out, which is why most matter you come across
is electrically neutral. But electrons are tiny 
and almost insignificant in mass, and rubbing or friction can give
loosely bound electrons enough energy to leave their atoms
and attach to others, migrating between different surfaces. When this happens, the first object is left 
with more protons than electrons and becomes positively charged, while the one with more electrons
accumulates a negative charge. This situation is called
a charge imbalance, or net charge separation. But nature tends towards balance, so when one of these newly charged bodies
comes into contact with another material, the mobile electrons 
will take the first chance they get to go where they're most needed, either jumping off the negatively
charged object, or jumping onto 
the positively charged one in an attempt to restore 
the neutral charge equilibrium. And this quick movement of electrons,
called static discharge, is what we recognize as that sudden spark. This process doesn't happen 
with just any objects. Otherwise you'd be getting 
zapped all the time. Conductors like metals and salt water tend to have loosely 
bound outer electrons, which can easily flow between molecules. On the other hand, insulators 
like plastics, rubber and glass have tightly bound electrons
that won't readily jump to other atoms. Static build-up is most likely to occur when one of the materials involved
is an insulator. When you walk across a rug, electrons from your body
will rub off onto it, while the rug's insulating wool
will resist losing its own electrons. Although your body and the rug
together are still electrically neutral, there is now a charge polarization
between the two. And when you reach to touch the door knob, zap! The metal door knob's loosely 
bound electrons hop to your hand to replace the electrons 
your body has lost. When it happens in your bedroom,
it's a minor nuisance. But in the great outdoors, static electricity can be a terrifying,
destructive force of nature. In certain conditions,
charge separation will occur in clouds. We don't know exactly how this happens. It may have to do with the circulation
of water droplets and ice particles within them. Regardless, the charge 
imbalance is neutralized by being released towards another body, such as a building, the Earth, or another cloud in a giant spark
that we know as lightning. And just as your fingers can be zapped
over and over in the same spot, you better believe that lightning 
can strike the same place more than once.","Static electricity is a natural phenomenon that happens when electrons move from one object to another. It can occur when two objects rub together, causing a charge imbalance. The object that loses electrons becomes positively charged, while the object that gains electrons becomes negatively charged. When the charged objects come into contact with a conductor, such as a metal doorknob or a cloud, the electrons move quickly to restore the neutral charge equilibrium, causing a spark. In nature, this can result in lightning, which is a giant spark between two charged bodies, such as clouds or the Earth. Lightning can strike the same place more than once, just like a finger can be zapped over and over in the same spot."
45,45,YeSuQm7KfaE,How do geckos defy gravity? - Eleanor Nelsen,"It's midnight and all is still, except for the soft skittering 
of a gecko hunting a spider. Geckos seem to defy gravity, scaling vertical surfaces and walking upside down
without claws, adhesive glues or super-powered spiderwebs. Instead, they take advantage 
of a simple principle: that positive 
and negative charges attract. That attraction binds together 
compounds, like table salt, which is made of positively
charged sodium ions stuck to negatively charged chloride ions. But a gecko's feet aren't charged and neither are the surfaces 
they're walking on. So, what makes them stick? The answer lies in a clever combination
of intermolecular forces and stuctural engineering. All the elements in the periodic table
have a different affinity for electrons. Elements like oxygen and fluorine
really, really want electrons, while elements like hydrogen and lithium
don't attract them as strongly. An atom's relative greed for electrons
is called its electronegativity. Electrons are moving around all the time and can easily relocate
to wherever they're wanted most. So when there are atoms with different
electronegativities in the same molecule, the molecules cloud of electrons gets pulled towards 
the more electronegative atom. That creates a thin spot 
in the electron cloud where positive charge 
from the atomic nuclei shines through, as well as a negatively charged 
lump of electrons somewhere else. So the molecule itself isn't charged, but it does have positively 
and negatively charged patches. These patchy charges can attract
neighboring molecules to each other. They'll line up so that 
the positive spots on one are next to the negative 
spots on the other. There doesn't even have to be a strongly
electronegative atom to create these attractive forces. Electrons are always on the move, and sometimes they pile up 
temporarily in one spot. That flicker of charge is enough
to attract molecules to each other. Such interactions between 
uncharged molecules are called van der Waals forces. They're not as strong as the interactions
between charged particles, but if you have enough of them,
they can really add up. That's the gecko's secret. Gecko toes are padded 
with flexible ridges. Those ridges are covered 
in tiny hair-like structures, much thinner than human hair,
called setae. And each of the setae is covered 
in even tinier bristles called spatulae. Their tiny spatula-like shape is perfect
for what the gecko needs them to do: stick and release on command. When the gecko unfurls its flexible toes
onto the ceiling, the spatulae hit at the perfect angle
for the van der Waals force to engage. The spatulae flatten, creating lots of surface area 
for their positively and negatively charged patches to find
complimentary patches on the ceiling. Each spatula only contributes a minuscule
amount of that van der Waals stickiness. But a gecko has about two billion of them, creating enough combined force 
to support its weight. In fact, the whole gecko could dangle
from a single one of its toes. That super stickiness 
can be broken, though, by changing the angle just a little bit. So, the gecko can peel its foot back off, scurrying towards a meal
or away from a predator. This strategy, using a forest 
of specially shaped bristles to maximize the van der Waals forces 
between ordinary molecules has inspired man-made materials designed to imitate 
the gecko's amazing adhesive ability. Artificial versions aren't as strong
as gecko toes quite yet, but they're good enough to allow 
a full-grown man to climb 25 feet up a glass wall. In fact, our gecko's prey is also using
van der Waals forces to stick to the ceiling. So, the gecko peels up its toes
and the chase is back on.","Geckos can walk on walls and ceilings due to a phenomenon called van der Waals forces. These forces occur when electrons in a molecule are unevenly distributed, creating positive and negative patches. When two such molecules come close, they stick together. Geckos have millions of tiny hairs called setae on their feet, which are covered in even tinier bristles called spatulae. These spatulae create a large surface area, allowing many van der Waals interactions to occur, making the gecko stick to surfaces. By changing the angle of their feet, geckos can easily detach and move around. This unique ability has inspired scientists to create adhesive materials that mimic gecko feet.

* Geckos use van der Waals forces to stick to surfaces, not gravity-defying glue or claws.
* Van der Waals forces occur when electrons in a molecule are unevenly distributed, creating positive and negative patches.

46,46,RwtO04EXgUE,Where did Earth’s water come from? - Zachary Metz,"It has no taste, color or smell,
and we often look right through it. It covers over 70% of the Earth, cycling from the oceans and rivers
to the clouds and back again. It even makes up about 60% of our bodies. With all this water around and inside us, it's easy to take 
its presence for granted. But in the rest of the solar system,
liquid water is almost impossible to find. So how did our planet end up 
with so much of this substance and where did it come from? As you probably know, a water molecule consists 
of two basic parts. Hydrogen, the simplest of all elements, has been around since close 
to the beginning of our universe. Oxygen entered the scene 
several hundred million years later after stars began to form. The massive pressure at the center
of these fiery infernos was so great that hydrogen atoms 
fused together to form helium. Helium, in turn, fused 
to form heavier elements, like beryllium, carbon and oxygen
in a process known as nucleosynthesis. When stars eventually collapsed
and exploded into supernovas, these new elements 
were spread across the universe and combined into new compounds,
like the now familiar H2O. These water molecules 
were present in the dusty cloud that formed our solar system and more collided with our planet
after its formation. But there's a big question 
that we don't have the answer to: how much water arrived on Earth, and when? If, as one theory goes, relatively small amounts of water were
present on Earth when the rock formed, the high temperatures 
and lack of any surrounding atmosphere would have caused it 
to evaporate back into space. Water would have been unable 
to remain on the planet until hundreds of millions of years later when our first atmosphere formed
through a process called outgassing. This occurred when 
molten rock in the Earth's core released volcanic gasses to the surface, creating a layer 
that could then trap escaping water. So how then did water 
get back to the planet? Scientists have long suspected that much of it was brought
by ice-bearing comets, or more likely asteroids that bombarded
the Earth over millions of years. Recent research 
has challenged this theory. In examining carbonaceous 
chondrite meterorites that formed shorty after the birth
of our solar system, scientists have found 
that not only did they contain water, but their mineral chemical composition
matched rocks on Earth and samples from an asteroid that 
formed at the same time as our planet. This suggests that the Earth 
may have accumulated a substantial amount of water early on
that was able to stay put, despite the lack of an atmosphere, though asteroids may 
have brought more over the eons. If this turns out to be true, life may have formed much earlier
than previously thought. So we do not yet definitively know
whether the water on Earth came from its initial formation, later impacts, or some combination of the two. Regardless, the water that runs from our
showers, drinking fountains and faucets is something that didn't just come from
a nearby lake or river, but first underwent a cosmic 
and chaotic journey to get here.","Water is a common substance on Earth, but it's rare in the rest of the solar system.

47,47,g09BQes-B7E,How parasites change their host's behavior - Jaap de Roode,"Which of these entities 
has evolved the ability to manipulate an animal
many times its size? The answer is all of them. These are all parasites, organisms that live on 
or inside another host organism, which they harm and sometimes even kill. Parasite survival depends on transmitting
from one host to the next, sometimes through 
an intermediate species. Our parasites elegantly achieve this
by manipulating their host's behavior, sometimes through direct brain hijacking. For example, this is the Gordian worm. One of its hosts, this cricket. The Gordian worm needs water to mate,
but the cricket prefers dry land. So once it's big enough to reproduce, the worm produces proteins that garble
the cricket's navigational system. The confused cricket 
jumps around erratically, moves closer to water, and eventually leaps in,
often drowning in the process. The worm then wriggles out to mate and its eggs get eaten 
by little water insects that mature, colonize land, and are, in turn, eaten by new crickets. And thus, the Gordian worm lives on. And here's the rabies virus,
another mind-altering parasite. This virus infects mammals, often dogs, and travels up the animal's 
nerves to its brain where it causes inflammation 
that eventually kills the host. But before it does, it often increases
its host's aggressiveness and ramps up the production
of rabies-transmitting saliva, while making it hard to swallow. These factors make the host 
more likely to bite another animal and more likely to pass 
the virus on when it does. And now, meet Ophiocordyceps,
also known as the zombie fungus. Its host of choice is tropical ants
that normally live in treetops. After Ophiocordyceps spores 
pierce the ant's exoskeleton, they set off convulsions 
that make the ant fall from the tree. The fungus changes the ant's behavior,
compelling it to wander mindlessly until it stumbles onto a plant leaf with
the perfect fungal breeding conditions, which it latches onto. The ant then dies, and the fungus parasitizes its body
to build a tall, thin stalk from its neck. Within several weeks, 
the stalk shoots off spores, which turn more ants 
into six-legged leaf-seeking zombies. One of humanity's most deadly assailants
is a behavior-altering parasite, though if it's any consolation, it's not our brains 
that are being hijacked. I'm talking about Plasmodium,
which causes malaria. This parasite needs mosquitoes
to shuttle it between hosts, so it makes them bite more frequently
and for longer. There's also evidence 
that humans infected with malaria are more attractive to mosquitoes, which will bite them 
and transfer the parasite further. This multi-species system is so effective, that there are hundreds of millions
of malaria cases every year. And finally, there are cats. Don't worry, there probably 
aren't any cats living in your body and controlling your thoughts. I mean, probably. But there is a microorganism
called Toxoplasma that needs both cats and rodents
to complete its life cycle. When a rat gets infected
by eating cat feces, the parasite changes chemical levels
in the rat's brain, making it less cautious
around the hungry felines, maybe even attracted to them. This makes them easy prey, so these infected rodents
get eaten and pass the parasite on. Mind control successful. There's even evidence that the parasite
affects human behavior. In most cases, 
we don't completely understand how these parasites manage 
their feats of behavior modification. But from what we do know, we can tell that they have 
a pretty diverse toolbox. Gordian worms seem to affect
crickets' brains directly. The malaria parasite, on the other hand, blocks an enzyme 
that helps the mosquitoes feed, forcing them to bite over 
and over and over again. The rabies virus may cause 
that snarling, slobbering behavior by putting the immune system
into overdrive. But whatever the method, when you think about how effectively these parasites control 
the behavior of their hosts, you may wonder how much of human behavior
is actually parasites doing the talking. Since more than half of the species
on Earth are parasites, it could be more than we think.","Parasites are organisms that live on or inside another host organism, causing harm and sometimes death. They manipulate their host's behavior to ensure their survival and transmission to the next host. For example, the Gordian worm makes crickets jump around erratically and leap into water, while the rabies virus increases aggressiveness and saliva production in mammals. The zombie fungus compels ants to wander aimlessly until they find the perfect breeding conditions, and the malaria parasite makes mosquitoes bite more frequently and for longer. The Toxoplasma parasite affects rat and human behavior, making them less cautious around cats. Parasites have a diverse toolbox to manipulate their hosts, and it's possible that more than half of human behavior is due to parasites."
48,48,9i7kAt97XYU,How we think complex cells evolved - Adam Jacobson,"What if you could absorb
another organism and take on its abilities? Imagine you swallowed a small bird
and suddenly gained the ability to fly. Or if you engulfed a cobra and were then able to spit poisonous venom
from your teeth. Throughout the history of life, specifically during the evolution 
of complex eukaryotic cells, things like this happened all the time. One organism absorbed another, and they united to become a new organism
with the combined abilities of both. We think that around 2 billion years ago, the only living organisms on Earth
were prokaryotes, single-celled organisms 
lacking membrane-bound organelles. Let's look closely at just three of them. One was a big, simple blob-like cell with the ability to absorb things 
by wrapping its cell membrane around them. Another was a bacterial cell that converted solar energy into sugar
molecules through photosynthesis. A third used oxygen gas to break down
materials like sugar and release its energy into a form useful
for life activities. The blob cells would occasionally absorb
the little photosynthetic bacteria. These bacteria then lived inside the blob
and divided like they always had, but their existence became linked. If you stumbled upon 
this living arrangement, you might just think that the whole thing
was one organism, that the green photosynthetic bacteria
were just a part of the blob that performed one of its life functions, just like your heart is a part of you that performs the function 
of pumping your blood. This process of cells living together
is called endosymbiosis, one organism living inside another. But the endosymbiosis didn't stop there. What would happen
if the other bacteria moved in, too? Now the cells of this species started
becoming highly complex. They were big and full 
of intricate structures that we call chloroplasts 
and mitochondria. These structures work together 
to harness sunlight, make sugar, and break down that sugar using the oxygen that right around this time started 
to appear in the Earth's atmosphere. Organisms absorbing other organisms was one way species adapted
to the changing environmental conditions of their surroundings. This little story highlights what 
biologists call the endosymbiotic theory, the current best explanation
of how complex cells evolved. There's a lot of evidence 
that supports this theory, but let's look at three main pieces. First, the chloroplasts and mitochondria
in our cells multiply the very same way as those ancient bacteria, which are still around, by the way. In fact, if you destroy these structures
in a cell, no new ones will appear. The cell can't make them. They can only make more of themselves. Second piece of evidence. Chloroplasts and mitochondria both contain
their own DNA and ribosomes. Their DNA has a circular structure that is strikingly similar to the DNA
of the ancient bacteria, and it also contains many similar genes. The ribosomes, or protein assembly 
machines of chloroplasts and mitochondria, also have the same structure as ribosomes
of ancient bacteria, but are different from the ribosomes hanging around
the rest of eukaryotic cell. Lastly, think about the membranes involved
in the engulfing process. Chloroplasts and mitochondria
both have two membranes surrounding them, an inner and outer membrane. Their inner membrane contains 
some particular lipids and proteins that are not present 
in the outer membrane. Why is that significant? Because their outer membrane
used to belong to the blob cell. When they were engulfed
in the endosymbiosis process, they got wrapped up in that membrane
and kept their own as their inner one. Surely enough, those same lipids and proteins are found on the membranes
of the ancient bacteria. Biologists now use this theory to explain the origin of the vast 
variety of eukaryotic organisms. Take the green algae that grow on 
the walls of swimming pools. A larger eukaryotic cell with spinning 
tail structures, or flagella, at some point absorbed algae like these
to form what we now call euglena. Euglena can perform photosynthesis, break down sugar using oxygen, and swim around pond water. And as the theory would predict, the chloroplasts in these euglena
have three membranes since they had two before being engulfed. The absorbing process
of endosymbiotic theory allowed organisms to combine 
powerful abilities to become better adapted to life on Earth. The results were species 
capable of much more than when they were separate organisms, and this was an evolutionary leap that lead to the microorganisms, plants, and animals we observe 
on the planet today.","The video explains how complex cells evolved through endosymbiosis, a process where one organism absorbs another and they unite to become a new organism with the combined abilities of both. Around 2 billion years ago, prokaryotes, single-celled organisms without membrane-bound organelles, were the only living organisms on Earth. A blob-like cell that could absorb things by wrapping its cell membrane around them, a bacterial cell that converted solar energy into sugar molecules through photosynthesis, and a cell that used oxygen gas to break down materials like sugar and release its energy into a form useful for life activities, were some of them. The blob cells would occasionally absorb the little photosynthetic bacteria, which then lived inside the blob and divided like they always had. This living arrangement is called endosymbiosis. The chloroplasts and mitochondria in our cells multiply the very same way as those ancient bacteria, contain their own DNA and ribosomes, and have two membranes surrounding them, an inner and outer membrane. The inner membrane contains some particular lipids and proteins that are not present in the outer membrane, which are also found on the membranes of the ancient bacteria. Biologists now use this theory to explain the origin of the vast variety of eukaryotic organisms."
49,49,p7fXa2Occ_U,"How do dogs \""see\"" with their noses? - Alexandra Horowitz","""Hi, Bob."" ""Morning, Kelly. The tulips looks great."" Have you ever wondered
how your dog experiences the world? Here's what she sees. Not terribly interesting. But what she smells,
that's a totally different story. And it begins at her wonderfully 
developed nose. As your dog catches 
the first hints of fresh air, her nose's moist, spongy outside helps
capture any scents the breeze carries. The ability to smell 
separately with each nostril, smelling in stereo, helps to determine the direction 
of the smell's source so that within the first 
few moments of sniffing, the dog starts to become aware of not
just what kind of things are out there but also where they're located. As air enters the nose, a small fold of tissue 
divides it into two separate folds, one for breathing 
and one just for smelling. This second airflow enters a region filled with highly specialized 
olfactory receptor cells, several hundred millions of them,
compaired to our five million. And unlike our clumsy way of breathing 
in and out through the same passage, dogs exhale through slits 
at the side of their nose, creating swirls of air that help
draw in new odor molecules and allow odor concentration to build up
over mulitple sniffs. But all that impressive nasal architecture
wouldn't be much help without something to process the loads
of information the nose scoops up. And it turns out that the olfactory system
dedicated to proessing smells takes up many times more relative
brain area in dogs than in humans. All of this allows dogs to distinguish and remember a staggering 
variety of specific scents at concentrations up to 100 million times
less than what our noses can detect. If you can smell a spritz of perfume
in a small room, a dog would have no trouble smelling it
in an enclosed stadium and distinguishing its ingredients,
to boot. And everything in the street,
every passing person or car, any contents of the neighbor's trash, each type of tree, and all the birds and insects in it has a distinct odor profile telling
your dog what it is, where it is, and which direction it's moving in. Besides being much 
more powerful than ours, a dog's sense of smell can pick up things
that can't even be seen at all. A whole separate olfactory system, called the vomeronasal organ,
above the roof of the mouth, detects the hormones all animals,
Including humans, naturally release. It lets dogs identify potential mates, or distinguish between friendly 
and hostile animals. It alerts them to our various 
emotional states, and it can even tell them 
when someone is pregnant or sick. Because olfaction is more primal 
than other senses, bypassing the thalamus to connect
directly to the brain structures involving emotion and instinct, we might even say a dog's perception 
is more immediate and visceral than ours. But the most amazing thing about 
your dog's nose is that it can traverse time. The past appears in tracks 
left by passersby, and by the warmth 
of a recently parked car where the residue of where you've been
and what you've done recently. Landmarks like fire hydrants and trees are aromatic bulletin boards 
carrying messages of who's been by, what they've been eating, and how they're feeling. And the future is in the breeze, alerting them to something or someone
approaching long before you see them. Where we see and hear something
at a single moment, a dog smells an entire story
from start to finish. In some of the best examples
of canine-human collaboration, dogs help us by sharing
and reacting to those stories. They can respond with kindness
to people in distress, or with aggression to threats because stress and anger 
manifest as a cloud of hormones recognizable to the dog's nose. With the proper training, they can even alert us 
to invisible threats ranging from bombs to cancer. As it turns out, humanity's best friend is not one who experiences 
the same things we do, but one whose incredible nose reveals 
a whole other world beyond our eyes.","Dogs have a powerful sense of smell, with 220 million olfactory receptors compared to humans' five million. They can smell in stereo, determining the direction of a scent's source. Dogs' noses have a fold of tissue that divides airflow into two separate folds, one for breathing and one for smelling. They exhale through slits at the side of their nose, creating swirls of air that help draw in new odor molecules. Dogs' olfactory system takes up many times more relative brain area than in humans, allowing them to distinguish and remember a variety of specific scents at concentrations up to 100 million times less than what humans can detect. They can even detect hormones and emotions through a separate olfactory system, the vomeronasal organ. A dog's sense of smell can traverse time, revealing past and future stories."
50,50,Z8wLQ3NCBgg,The truth about bats - Amy Wray,"Flying through the night, 
I watch over this world, a silent guardian, a watchful protector,
a dark knight, I'm... Okay, fine. So, I'm not Batman.
I'm just a bat. But like Batman, I'm often misunderstood. People think I'm scary, 
strange and dangerous. If they only knew my story, though,
I'd be cheered as a hero. When people think of bats, many think of vampires 
who want to suck their blood. But the truth is 
that out of over 1200 bat species, only three are vampire bats. Out of these three, 
only one prefers the blood of mammals, and even these bats mostly feed on cattle. Maybe that still doesn't seem so great, but vampire bats 
can be a great help to humans. A chemical known as desmoteplase 
found in vampire bat saliva helps break down blood clots, and is being tested 
by recovering stroke victims. Of the remaining 1000+ species of bats, 
about 70% feed on insects. These bats help control 
the real vampires: mosquitos, whose nasty bites
are not just annoying but spread diseases, like West Nile virus. A single little brown bat 
can eat 1000 insects every hour, and a colony of Mexican free-tailed bats 
can eat several tons of moths in just one night. In the United States alone, bats provide an estimated 
3.7 billion dollars worth of free pest control for farmers, which benefits everyone 
who eats the foods that they grow. Fruit bats, also called megabats 
because of their large size, are important for the role 
they play in plant pollination. By traveling between flowers 
while feeding on nectar and fruits, these bats transport the pollen 
and seeds that help plants reproduce. In Southeast Asia, for example, the cave nectar bat is the only pollinator
of the durian fruit. Other bats pollinate peaches, bananas, and the agave plants 
that tequila is made from. Without them, many of our food plants would be unable 
to produce the tasty fruits we enjoy. As heroes of the ecosystem, 
bats have their own unique utility belts. Bats have been a source of inspiration 
for the design of flying robots and even an energy-efficient spy plane, as they are the only mammal 
capable of true powered flight. Echolocation, a type of biological sonar,
is also used by bats as a way to navigate and find prey in the dark. Although there's a common 
misconception that bats are blind, in truth, all species of bats have sight. And some have even adapted 
large eyes to see better in dim lighting. Many people worry 
about getting infected by bats, and like any other animals,
bats can carry diseases, like rabies. In reality, though, less than .5% of all bats
carry this virus. That's about the same odds as getting 
the same result on a coin flip eight times in a row. The perception that bats 
are often diseased may come from the fact that sick bats, who may show unusual behavior, 
emerge during the daytime, or be unable to fly, are more likely to be 
encountered by people. So a good way to protect yourself 
is to protect bats as well, keeping them healthy,
protecting their habitats, and reducing their risk 
of transmitting disease. In North America, bats are threatened 
by a devastating sickness called white-nose syndrome. This fungal infection 
causes bats to wake up while hibernating during a winter. Unable to find food, 
they expend large amounts of energy, and eventually starve to death. White-nose syndrome has wiped out
entire caves full of bats, with a mortality rate that can exceed 90%. Climate change and habitat destruction also pose serious threats 
to bat populations. For example, in January 2014,
a record heat wave in Australia caused over 100,000 bats 
to die from heat exhaustion. Some people just want 
to watch the world burn, and bats all over the world are threatened
by damage to the places that we call home, including mangrove swamps, old-growth forests, and, of course, bat caves. So even though I'm the hero of the story,
I do need to be saved. And now that you know 
the true story about us bats, you can learn how to protect 
such heroic animals. Install a properly designed bat box, one of the easiest ways 
to provide shelter for bats. Discourage the use of pesticides,
which can harm bats when we try to feed on the insects 
you want to get rid of in the first place. Avoid going into caves 
where you might disturb hibernating bats, and always decontaminate 
your gear after visiting a cave. If you have unwanted bats 
living in an attic or barn, contact your local government 
to safely and humanely relocate us. And if you come across a bat, 
do not attempt to handle it, but instead, call Animal Control. Batman might want to keep 
his identity secret, but a great way to help real bats
is by continuing to learn about them and spreading the truth 
that they are real heroes, even if their good deeds are often unseen.","Bats are often misunderstood creatures, feared as vampires who want to suck human blood. However, only three out of 1200 bat species are vampire bats, and they mostly feed on cattle. The remaining 1000+ species of bats are helpful to humans, with 70% feeding on insects, controlling mosquito populations, and providing free pest control for farmers. Fruit bats help in plant pollination, while their echolocation and flight abilities have inspired flying robots and energy-efficient spy planes. Although bats can carry diseases like rabies, less than .5% of all bats carry this virus. Climate change, habitat destruction, and white-nose syndrome threaten bat populations, but installing bat boxes, avoiding pesticides, and contacting Animal Control when encountering bats can help protect these heroes of the ecosystem."
51,51,B-vYGcl_nA8,The hidden worlds within natural history museums - Joshua Drew,"When you think of natural history museums, you probably picture exhibits 
filled with ancient lifeless things, like dinosaurs meteroites, and gemstones. But behind that educational exterior, which only includes 
about 1% of a museum's collection, there are hidden laboratories 
where scientific breakthroughs are made. Beyond the unmarked doors, and on the floors 
the elevators won't take you to, you'd find windows into amazing worlds. This maze of halls and laboratories 
is a scientific sanctuary that houses a seemingly 
endless variety of specimens. Here, researchers work to unravel 
mysteries of evolution, cosmic origins, and the history of our planet. One museum alone 
may have millions of specimens. The American Museum of Natural History
in New York City has over 32,000,000 in its collection. Let's take a look at just one of them. Scientists have logged exactly
where and when it was found and used various dating techniques 
to pinpoint when it originated. Repeat that a million times over,
and these plants, animals, minerals, fossils, and artifacts present windows 
into times and places around the world and across billions of years of history. When a research problem emerges, scientists peer through these windows
and test hypotheses about the past. For example, in the 1950s, 
populations of predatory birds, like peregrine falcons, owls, and eagles started to mysteriously crash, to the point where a number of species,
including the bald eagle, were declared endangered. Fortunately, scientists in 
The Field Museum in Chicago had been collecting the eggs 
of these predatory birds for decades. They discovered that the egg shells 
used to be thicker and had started to thin around the time when an insecticide called DDT 
started being sprayed on crops. DDT worked very well to kill insects, but when birds came and ate
those heaps of dead bugs, the DDT accumulated in their bodies. It worked its way up the food chain and was absorbed by apex predator birds
in such high concentrations that it thinned their eggs so that they couldn't support 
the nesting bird's weight. There were omelettes everywhere until scientists from 
The Field Museum in Chicago, and other institutions, helped solve the mystery and save the day. America thanks you, Field Museum. Natural history museums 
windows into the past have solved many other 
scientific mysteries. Museum scientists have used 
their collections to sequence the Neanderthal genome, discover genes that gave mammoths red fur, and even pinpoint where 
ancient giant sharks gave birth. There are about 900 
natural history museums in the world, and every year they make 
new discoveries and insights into the Earth's past, present and future. Museum collections even help us 
understand how modern threats, such as global climate change, are impacting our world. For instance, 
naturalists have been collecting samples for over 100 years from Walden Pond, famously immortalized 
by Henry David Thoreau. Thanks to those naturalists,
who count Thoreau among their number, we know that the plants around Walden Pond are blooming over three weeks earlier 
than they did 150 years ago. Because these changes 
have taken place gradually, one person may not have noticed them
over the span of a few decades, but thanks to museum collections, we have an uninterrupted record 
showing how our world is changing. So the next time you're exploring 
a natural history museum, remember that what you're seeing 
is just one gem of a colossal scientific treasure trove. Behind those walls and under your feet
are windows into forgotten worlds. And who knows? One day some future scientist may 
peer through one and see you.","Natural history museums are not just about ancient lifeless things.

52,52,lSXNqsOoURg,Why elephants never forget - Alex Gendler,"It's a common saying
that elephants never forget, but these magnificent animals are more
than giant walking hard drives. The more we learn about elephants, the more it appears
that their impressive memory is only one aspect
of an incredible intelligence that makes them
some of the most social, creative, and benevolent creatures on Earth. Unlike many proverbs,
the one about elephant memory is scientifically accurate. Elephants know every member
in their herd, able to recognize as many as 30
companions by sight or smell. This is a great help when migrating or encountering
other potentially hostile elephants. They also remember and distinguish
particular cues that signal danger and can recall important locations long
after their last visit. But it's the memories unrelated
to survival that are the most fascinating. Elephants remember
not only their herd companions but other creatures who have made
a strong impression on them. In one case, two circus elephants
that had briefly performed together rejoiced when crossing paths
23 years later. This recognition isn't limited to others
of their species. Elephants have also recognized humans
they've bonded with after decades apart. All of this shows that elephant memory
goes beyond responses to stimuli. Looking inside their heads,
we can see why. The elephant boasts the largest brain
of any land mammal, as well as an impressive
encephalization quotient. This is the size of the brain
relative to what we'd expect for an animal's body size, and the elephant's EQ is nearly as high
as a chimpanzee's. And despite the distant relation, convergent evolution has made it
remarkably similar to the human brain, with as many neurons and synapses and a highly developed hippocampus
and cerebral cortex. It is the hippocampus, strongly associated
with emotion, that aids recollection by encoding important experiences
into long-term memories. The ability to distinguish this importance
makes elephant memory a complex and adaptable faculty
beyond rote memorization. It's what allows elephants who survived
a drought in their youth to recognize its warning signs
in adulthood, which is why clans with older matriarchs
have higher survival rates. Unfortunately, it's also what makes
elephants one of the few non-human animals to suffer from post-traumatic
stress disorder. The cerebral cortex, on the other hand,
enables problem solving, which elephants display
in many creative ways. They also tackle problems cooperatively, sometimes even outwitting the researchers
and manipulating their partners. And they've grasped basic arithmetic,
keeping track of the relative amounts of fruit in two baskets
after multiple changes. The rare combination of memory
and problem solving can explain some of elephants'
most clever behaviors, but it doesn't explain some of the things
we're just beginning to learn about their mental lives. Elephants communicate using everything
from body signals and vocalizations, to infrasound rumbles that can be heard
kilometers away. And their understanding of syntax suggests that
they have their own language and grammar. This sense of language may even go beyond
simple communication. Elephants create art by carefully
choosing and combining different colors and elements. They can also recognize twelve distinct
tones of music and recreate melodies. And yes, there is an elephant band. But perhaps the most amazing thing
about elephants is a capacity even more important
than cleverness: their sense of empathy,
altruism, and justice. Elephants are the only non-human animals
to mourn their dead, performing burial rituals
and returning to visit graves. They have shown concern
for other species, as well. One working elephant refused
to set a log down into a hole where a dog was sleeping, while elephants encountering injured
humans have sometimes stood guard and gently comforted them
with their trunk. On the other hand, elephant attacks
on human villages have usually occurred right after
massive poachings or cullings, suggesting deliberate revenge. When we consider all this evidence, along with the fact that elephants
are one of the few species who can recognize themselves in a mirror, it's hard to escape the conclusion that they are conscious,
intelligent, and emotional beings. Unfortunately, humanity's treatment
of elephants does not reflect this, as they continue to suffer
from habitat destruction in Asia, ivory poaching in Africa,
and mistreatment in captivity worldwide. Given what we now know about elephants and what they continue to teach us
about animal intelligence, it is more important than ever to ensure that what the English poet John Donne
described as ""nature's great masterpiece"" does not vanish from the world's canvas.","Elephants are known for their incredible memory, but they are also highly intelligent creatures with a complex social structure. They can recognize up to 30 companions and remember them for many years. Elephants have a highly developed hippocampus, which aids in recollection and encoding important experiences into long-term memories. They also have a highly developed cerebral cortex, which enables problem-solving and cooperative behavior. Elephants have been observed to display basic arithmetic skills and have a sense of language and grammar. They are also known for their empathy, altruism, and sense of justice. Unfortunately, elephants continue to suffer from habitat destruction, ivory poaching, and mistreatment in captivity.

* Elephants can recognize up to 30 companions by sight or smell.
* Elephants have a highly developed hippocampus, which aids in recollection and encoding important experiences into long-term memories.
* Elephants have a highly developed cerebral cortex, which enables problem-solving and cooperative behavior.
* Elephants have been observed to display basic arithmetic skills and have a sense of language and grammar.

* Elephants perform burial rituals and return to visit graves.
* Elephants have shown concern for other species, such as dogs and humans.

* Elephants can recognize themselves in a mirror.

Friendly tone and simple English:

Hey there! Did you know that elephants are super smart and have amazing memories? They can remember their friends for many years and even recognize other animals they've met before. Elephants have a big brain and a special part of their brain called the hippocampus that helps them remember things. They can also solve problems and even understand some language and grammar. But what's really cool is that elephants are also very empathetic and caring. They take care of their friends and family, and they even mourn their dead. It's so important to protect these amazing animals and make sure they have a safe and happy home."
53,53,z9HIYjRRaDE,Where do genes come from? - Carl Zimmer,"You have about 20,000 genes in your DNA. They encode the molecules that
make up your body, from the keratin in your toenails,
to the collagen at the tip of your nose, to the dopamine surging around
inside your brain. Other species have genes of their own. A spider has genes for spider silk. An oak tree has genes for chlorophyll,
which turns sunlight into wood. So where did all those genes come from? It depends on the gene. Scientists suspect that life
started on Earth about 4 billion years ago. The early life forms were
primitive microbes with a basic set of genes for
the basic tasks required to stay alive. They passed down those basic genes
to their offspring through billions of generations. Some of them still do the same jobs
in our cells today, like copying DNA. But none of those microbes had genes
for spider silk or dopamine. There are a lot more genes on Earth today
than there were back then. It turns out that a lot of those
extra genes were born from mistakes. Each time a cell divides,
it makes new copies of its DNA. Sometimes it accidentally copies
the same stretch of DNA twice. In the process, it may make an extra copy
of one of its genes. At first, the extra gene works the same
as the original one. But over the generations, 
it may pick up new mutations. Those mutations may change how
the new gene works, and that new gene may duplicate again. A surprising number of our 
mutated genes emerged more recently; many in just the past few million years. The youngest evolved after our own species
broke off from our cousins, the apes. While it may take over a million years
for a single gene to give rise to a whole family of genes, scientists are finding that once 
the new genes evolve, they can quickly take on
essential functions. For example, we have hundreds of genes
for the proteins in our noses that grab odor molecules. The mutations let them grab
different molecules, giving us the power to perceive trillions
of different smells. Sometimes mutations have
a bigger effect on new copies of genes. They may cause a gene to make its
protein in a different organ, or at a different time of life, or the protein may start doing
a different job altogether. In snakes, for example, there's a gene
that makes a protein for killing bacteria. Long ago, the gene duplicated
and the new copy mutated. That mutation changed
the signal in the gene about where it should make its protein. Instead of becoming active in
the snake's pacreas, it started making this bacteria-killing
protein in the snake's mouth. So when the snake bit its prey,
this enzyme got into the animal's wound. And when this protein proved
to have a harmful effect, and helped the snake catch more prey, it became favored. So now what was a gene in the pancreas
makes a venom in the mouth that kills the snake's prey. And there are even more incredible ways
to make a new gene. The DNA of animals and plants
and other species contain huge stretches without any
protein coding genes. As far as scientists can tell,
its mostly random sequences of genetic gibberish that serve
no function. These stretches of DNA
sometimes mutate, just like genes do. Sometimes those mutations
turn the DNA into a place where a cell can start reading it. Suddenly the cell is making a new protein. At first, the protein may be useless,
or even harmful, but more mutations can 
change the shape of the protein. The protein may start
doing something useful, something that makes an organism
healthier, stronger, better able to reproduce. Scientists have found these new genes
at work in many parts of animal bodies. So our 20,000 genes have many origins, from the origin of life, to new genes
still coming into existence from scratch. As long as life is here on Earth,
it will be making new genes.","The video explains where genes come from. Genes are the building blocks of life, responsible for the creation of various molecules in the body. The first life forms had a basic set of genes, which they passed down to their offspring. However, most of the genes we have today were born from mistakes during DNA replication. These mistakes can lead to the creation of extra copies of genes, which can then mutate and evolve to perform new functions. For example, a gene that was once active in the pancreas can mutate and become active in the mouth, creating venom in snakes. New genes can also emerge from non-coding DNA, which can mutate and become a place where cells can start reading and creating new proteins.

Curious facts:

* Life on Earth started about 4 billion years ago with primitive microbes that had a basic set of genes.
* Most of the genes we have today were born from mistakes during DNA replication.

54,54,inVZoI1AkC8,Feedback loops: How nature gets its rhythms - Anje-Margriet Neutel,"Testing, testing, one, two, three. When your band is trying to perform,
feedback is an annoying obstacle, but in the grand orchestra of nature,
feedback is not only beneficial, it's what makes everything work. What exactly is feedback? The key element, whether in sound,
the environment or social science, is a phenomenon called
mutual causal interaction, where x affects y, y affects x, and so on, creating an ongoing process called 
a feedback loop. And the natural world is full 
of these mechanisms formed by the links between living 
and nonliving things that build resilience by governing 
the way populations and food webs respond to events. When plants die, the dead material
enriches the soil with humus, a stable mass of organic matter,
providing moisture and nutrients for other plants to grow. The more plants grow and die,
the more humus is produced, allowing even more plants to grow,
and so on. This is an example of positive feedback, an essential force
in the buildup of ecosystems. But it's not called positive feedback
because it's beneficial. Rather, it is positive because it amplifies
a particular effect or change from previous conditions. These positive, or amplifying, loops
can also be harmful, like when removing a forest 
makes it vulnerable to erosion, which removes organic matter
and nutrients from the earth, leaving less plants to anchor the soil,
and leading to more erosion. In contrast, negative feedback diminishes
or counteracts changes in an ecosystem to maintain a more stable balance. Consider predators and their prey. When lynx eat snowshoe hares,
they reduce their population, but this drop in the lynx's food source will
soon cause their own population to decline, reducing the predation rate and allowing 
the hare population to increase again. The ongoing cycle creates an up and down
wavelike pattern, maintaining a long-term equilibrium and
allowing a food chain to persist over time. Feedback processes might seem
counterintuitive because many of us are used to more predictable linear
scenarios of cause and effect. For instance, it seems simple enough that spraying pesticides would help plants grow
by killing pest insects, but it may trigger a host of other
unexpected reactions. For example, if spraying pushes down
the insect population, its predators will have less food. As their population dips, the reduced predation would allow the
insect population to rise, counteracting the effects of 
our pesticides. Note that each feedback is
the product of the links in the loop. Add one negative link and it will
reverse the feedback force entirely, and one weak link will reduce the
effect of the entire feedback considerably. Lose a link, and the whole loop is broken. But this is only a simple example, since natural communities consist not 
of separate food chains, but networks of interactions. Feedback loops will often be indirect,
occurring through longer chains. A food web containing twenty populations
can generate thousands of loops of up to twenty links in length. But instead of forming a disordered 
cacophany, feedback loops in ecological systems
play together, creating regular patterns
just like multiple instruments, coming together to create a complex
but harmonious piece of music. Wide-ranging negative feedbacks
keep the positive feedbacks in check, like drums maintaining a rhythm. You can look at the way a particular
ecosystem functions within its unique habitat as representing its trademark sound. Ocean environments dominated 
by predator-prey interactions, and strong negative and positive loops
stabilized by self-damping feedback, are powerful and loud,
with many oscillations. Desert ecosystems, where the 
turn over of biomass is slow, and the weak feedbacks loops through dead
matter are more like a constant drone. And the tropical rainforest,
with its great diversity of species, high nutrient turnover, and strong feedbacks
among both living and dead matter, is like a lush panoply of sounds. Despite their stabilizing effects, many of these habitats and their 
ecosystems develop and change over time, as do the harmonies they create. Deforestation may turn lush tropics
into a barren patch, like a successful ensemble breaking up
after losing its star performers. But an abandoned patch of farmland
may also become a forest over time, like a garage band growing into
a magnificent orchestra.","Feedback loops are a crucial part of nature, where x affects y, y affects x, and so on. They can be positive or negative. Positive feedback amplifies a particular effect or change from previous conditions, while negative feedback diminishes or counteracts changes in an ecosystem to maintain a more stable balance. Feedback loops are essential in the buildup of ecosystems and can be harmful or beneficial. For example, when lynx eat snowshoe hares, they reduce their population, but this drop in the lynx's food source will soon cause their own population to decline, reducing the predation rate and allowing the hare population to increase again. The ongoing cycle creates an up and down wavelike pattern, maintaining a long-term equilibrium and allowing a food chain to persist over time."
55,55,lmWh9jV_1ac,How do tornadoes form? - James Spann,"They call me the tornado chaser. When the wind is up 
and conditions are right, I get in my car and follow violent storms. ""Crazy,"" you say? Perhaps, but really I
chase these sky beasts to learn about them. I want to share with you what I know. Tornadoes are rapidly rotating columns
of air that form inside storms that connect with the ground via
a funnel of cloud. When that happens, 
they tear across the Earth, posing a huge threat to life and property. Because of this, there's a great deal
of research into these phenomena, but the truth is, there's still a lot
we don't know about how tornadoes form. The conditions that may 
give rise to one tornado won't necessarily cause another. But we have learned a lot since
people first started recording tornadoes, like how to recognize the signs
when one is brewing in the sky. Are you coming along for the ride? Tornadoes begin with a thunderstorm
but not just any thunderstorm. These are especially powerful, towering
thunderstorms called supercells. Reaching up to over 50,000 feet,
they bring high force winds, giant hailstones, sometimes flooding
and great flashes of lightning, too. These are the kinds of storms
that breed tornadoes, but only if there are also very
specific conditions in place, clues that we can measure and look out for
when we're trying to forecast a storm. Rising air is the first ingredient needed
for a tornado to develop. Any storm is formed 
when condensation occurs, the byproducts of the clouds. Condensation releases heat, and heat becomes the energy that drives
huge upward drafts of air. The more condensation
and the bigger the storm clouds grow, the more powerful those updrafts become. In supercells, this rising airmass 
is particularly strong. As the air climbs, it can change direction
and start to move more quickly. Finally, at the storm's base,
if there is a lot of moisture, a huge cloud base develops,
giving the tornado something to feed off later,
if it gets that far. When all these things are in place,
a vortex can develop enclosed by the storm, and forming a wide, tall tube of spinning
air that then gets pulled upwards. We call this a mesocyclone. Outside, cool, dry, sinking air starts to wrap around the back of
this mesocyclone, forming what's known as a
rear flank downdraft. This unusual scenario creates 
a stark temperature difference between the air inside the mesocyclone,
and the air outside, building up a level of instability
that allows a tornado to thrive. Then, the mesocyclone's lower part
becomes tighter, increasing the speed of the wind. If, and that's a big if,
this funnel of air moves down into that large, moist cloud base
at the bottom of the parent storm, it sucks it in and turns it 
into a rotating wall of cloud, forming a link between 
the storm that created it and the Earth. The second that tube of
spinning cloud touches the ground, it becomes a tornado. Most are small and short-lived,
producing winds of 65-110 miles per hour, but others can last for over an hour,
producing 200 mile per hour winds. They are beautiful but terrifying, especially if you or 
your town is in its path. In that case, no one,
not even tornado chasers like me, enjoy watching thing unfold. Just like everything, however,
tornadoes do come to an end. When the temperature difference disappears
and conditions grow more stable, or the moisture in the air dries up, the once fierce parent storm loses
momentum and draws its tornado back inside. Even so, meteorologists and storm chasers
like me will remain on the lookout, watching, always watching to see
if the storm releases its long rope again.","Tornadoes are rapidly rotating columns of air that form inside storms and connect with the ground via a funnel of cloud. They are formed inside powerful thunderstorms called supercells. The conditions that may give rise to one tornado won't necessarily cause another.

56,56,KMudRLPZidg,What's hidden among the tallest trees on Earth? - Wendell Oshiro,"Some people can't see 
the forest for the trees, but before Stephen Sillett, no one could see
or even imagine the forest in the trees. Stephen was an explorer of 
new worlds from the start. He spent his boyhood in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania reading Tolkien and playing 
Dungeons and Dragons with his brother Scott. But when the Sillett family visited 
their grandparent's cabin near Gettysburg, their grandmother Helen Poe Sillett, would take the boys into the nearby 
mountains and forests to bird-watch. They called Grandma Sillett Poe, and she taught the boys to identify 
songbirds, plants and even lichens, creatures that often look like splotches of carpet
glued to the shady sides of rocks and tree trunks. Looking upwards, 
both boys found their callings. Scott became a research scientist 
specializing in migratory birds. Stephen was more interested in the trees. The tangle of branches and leaves
attracted his curiosity. What could be hidden up there? By the time Stephen was in college,
that curiosity pulled him skyward to the tallest trees on Earth:
the ancient coast redwoods of Northern California. Rising from trunks 
up to 20 feet in diameter, redwoods can grow up to 380 feet, or 38 stories,
over a 2,000 year lifetime. But no one had thought to investigate 
the crowns of these natural skyscrapers. Were there more than 
just branches up there? Stephen decided to find out firsthand. In 1987, Stephen, his brother Scott
and his friend Marwood drove from Reed College in Oregon to Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park
in Northern California. Deep inside the park,
Stephen picked the tallest redwood he could find. Its lowest branches
were almost 100 feet up, far beyond his reach. But he saw a younger, shorter redwood 
growing next to the target tree. With a running start, he leapt 
and grabbed the lowest branch, pulled himself up and scurried upwards. He was free climbing
without ropes or a harness, one misstep meant death. But up he went, 
and when he reached the peak, he swayed and leapt across the gap of space
onto a branch of the target tree and into a world never seen before. His buddy Marwood followed him up, and the two young men free climbed
high into the redwood's crown. Stephen came across lichens
like Grandma Poe had shown him as a boy. He noticed that the higher he went,
the thicker the branches were, not the case with most trees. He found moist mats of soil many inches thick, made from fallen needles, bark,
other plant debris and dust from the sky piled on the tops of the large branches. He even found reiterations: new redwood tree trunks 
growing out from the main trunk. The redwood had cloned itself. When Stephen reached the pinnacle, he rested on a platform of 
crisscrossing branches and needles. Growing in the soil mat was a 
huckleberry bush with ripe berries! He ate some and waited for his friend. Stephen had discovered a new world
hundreds of feet above the ground. His climb led to more excursions,
with safety equipment, thank goodness, up other ancient redwoods
as he mapped and measured the architecture of branches and additional trunks
in the canopy of an entire grove. Stephen became an expert
in the ecology of the tallest trees on Earth and the rich diversity of life in their crowns,
aerial ecosystems no one had imagined. There are ferns, fungi and epiphytic trees
normally found at ground level like Douglas firs, hemlocks and tan oaks whose roots had taken hold
in the rich wet soil mats. Invertebrates such as ants, bumblebees, 
mites, beetles, earthworms and aquatic crustacean copepods make their homes alongside
flowering plants like rhododendrons, currant
and elderberry bushes. Ospreys, spotted owls, and jays
search the canopy for food. Even the marbled murrelet, 
a Pacific seabird, flies many miles from the ocean
to nest there. Squirrels and voles 
peek out of penthouse burrows. And the top predator?
The mighty wandering salamander! Sillett's research has changed
how we think about tall trees, and bolstered the case
for their conservation, not just as impressive
individual organisms but as homes to countless other species. So when you look up into 
the branches and leaves of a tree, ask, ""What else is up there?"" A new world might be just out of reach.

57,57,ujKL1pUHDfo,The coelacanth: A living fossil of a fish - Erin Eastwood,"The dead coming back to life sounds scary. But for scientists, it can be
a wonderful opportunity. Of course, we're not talking about zombies. Rather, this particular opportunity
came in the unlikely form of large, slow-moving fish
called the coelacanth. This oddity dates back 360 million years, and was believed to have died out
during the same mass extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs
65 million years ago. To biologists and paleontologists,
this creature was a very old and fascinating but entirely extinct fish,
forever fossilized. That is, until 1938 when Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer,
a curator at a South African museum, came across a prehistoric looking, gleaming
blue fish hauled up at the nearby docks. She had a hunch that this strange,
1.5 meter long specimen was important but couldn't preserve it in time
to be studied and had it taxidermied. When she finally was able to
reach J.L.B. Smith, a local fish expert, he was able to confirm, at first site,
that the creature was indeed a coelacanth. But it was another 14 years before
a live specimen was found in the Comoros Islands, allowing scientists to
closely study a creature that had barely evolved
in 300 million years. A living fossil. Decades later, a second species
was found near Indonesia. The survival of creatures
thought extinct for so long proved to be one of the
biggest discoveries of the century. But the fact that the coelacanth
came back from the dead isn't all that makes
this fish so astounding. Even more intriguing is the fact that
genetically and morphologically, the coelacanth has more in common
with four-limbed vertebrates than almost any other fish,
and its smaller genome is ideal for study. This makes the coelacanth a powerful link
between aquatic and land vertebrates, a living record of their transition from
water to land millions of years ago. The secret to this transition is in the fins. While the majority of ocean fish
fall into the category of ray-finned fishes, coelacanths are part of a much smaller,
evolutionarily distinct group with thicker fins known as lobe-finned fish. Six of the coelacanth's fins contain bones
organized much like our limbs, with one bone connecting
the fin to the body, another two connecting the bone
to the tip of the fin, and several small,
finger-like bones at the tip. Not only are those fins structured
in pairs to move in a synchronized way, the coelacanth even shares
the same genetic sequence that promotes limb development
in land vertebrates. So although the coelacanth
itself isn't a land-walker, its fins do resemble those
of its close relatives who first hauled their bodies onto land with the help of these
sturdy, flexible appendages, acting as an evolutionary bridge
to the land lovers that followed. So that's how this prehistoric fish
helps explain the evolutionary movement of vertebrates from water to land. Over millions of years, 
that transition led to the spread of all
four-limbed animals, called tetrapods, like amphibians, birds, and even
the mammals that are our ancestors. There's even another powerful clue in that unlike most fish,
coelacanths don't lay eggs, instead giving birth to live, young pups,
just like mammals. And this prehistoric fish will continue to
provide us with fascinating information about the migration of vertebrates
out of the ocean over 300 million years ago. A journey that ultimately drove
our own evolution, survival and existence. Today the coelacanth remains the symbol
of the wondrous mysteries that remain to be uncovered by science. With so much left to learn about this fish,
the ocean depths and evolution itself, who knows what other well-kept secrets
our future discoveries may bring to life!","The coelacanth is a fish that was thought to be extinct for 65 million years, but was rediscovered in 1938. It is a ""living fossil"" that has barely evolved in 300 million years and is a powerful link between aquatic and land vertebrates.

58,58,vG-QZOTc5_Q,Inside the ant colony - Deborah M. Gordon,"Think about all the things that need to happen for a human settlement to thrive: obtaining food, building shelter, raising children and more. There needs to be a way to divide resources, organize major efforts and distribute labor efficiently. Now imagine having to do this without any sort of planning or higher level communication. Welcome to the ant colony. Ants have some of the most complex social organization in the animal kingdom, living in structured colonies containing different types of members who perform specific roles. But although this may sound similar to some human societies, this organization doesn't arise from any higher level decisions, but is part of a biologically programmed cycle. In many species, all the winged males and winged virgin queens from all the nearby colonies in the population each leave from their different nests and meet at a central place to mate, using pheromones to guide each other to a breeding ground. After mating, the males die off, while females try to establish a new colony. The few that are successful settle down in a suitable spot, lose their wings, and begin laying eggs, selectively fertilizing some using stored sperm they've saved up from mating. Fertilized eggs grow into female workers who care for the queen and her eggs. They will then defend the colony and forage for food, while unfertilized eggs grow into males whose only job is to wait until they are ready to leave the nest and reproduce, beginning the cycle again. So how do worker ants decide what to do and when? Well, they don't really. Although they have no methods of intentional communication, individual ants do interact with one another through touch, sound and chemical signals. These stimuli accomplish many things from serving as an alarm to other ants if one is killed, to signaling when a queen is nearing the end of her reproductive life. But one of the most impressive collective capabilities of an ant colony is to thoroughly and efficiently explore large areas without any predetermined plan. Most species of ants have little or no sense of sight and can only smell things in their vicinity. Combined with their lack of high level coordination, this would seem to make them terrible explorers, but there is an amazingly simple way that ants maximize their searching efficiency; by changing their movement patterns based on individual interactions. When two ants meet, they sense each other by touching antennae. If there are many ants in a small area this will happen more often causing them to respond by moving in more convoluted, random paths in order to search more thoroughly. But in a larger area, with less ants, where such meetings happen less often, they can walk in straight lines to cover more ground. While exploring their environment in this way, an ant may come across any number of things, from threats or enemies, to alternate nesting sites. And some species have another capability known as recruitment. When one of these ants happens to find food, it will return with it, marking its path with a chemical scent. Other ants will then follow this pheromone trail, renewing it each time they manage to find food and return. Once the food in that spot is depleted, the ants stop marking their return. The scent dissipates and ants are no longer attracted to that path. These seemingly crude methods of search and retrieval are, in fact, so useful that they are applied in computer models to obtain optimal solutions from decentralized elements, working randomly and exchanging simple information. This has many theoretical and practical applications, from solving the famous traveling salesman problem, to scheduling computing tasks and optimizing Internet searches, to enabling groups of robots to search a minefield or a burning building collectively, without any central control. But you can observe these fascinatingly simple, yet effective, processes directly through some simple experiments, by allowing ants to enter empty spaces of various sizes and paying attention to their behavior. Ants may not be able to vote, hold meetings or even make any plans, but we humans may still be able to learn something from the way that such simple creatures are able to function so effectively in such complex ways.","Ant colonies are fascinatingly complex, with different types of members performing specific roles. However, this organization doesn't come from any higher level decisions, but is part of a biologically programmed cycle. Winged males and virgin queens from different colonies meet to mate, and the females establish new colonies. Worker ants perform tasks like caring for the queen and her eggs, defending the colony, and foraging for food. Ants interact with one another through touch, sound, and chemical signals, and they change their movement patterns based on individual interactions to explore their environment efficiently. Some species have the capability of recruitment, where ants mark their path with a chemical scent to lead other ants to food. These simple yet effective processes have inspired computer models and have practical applications in various fields."
59,59,fHztd6k5ZXY,A guide to the energy of the Earth - Joshua M. Sneideman,"Energy is all around us, a physical quantity that follows
precise natural laws. Our universe has a finite amount of it; it's neither created nor destroyed but can take different forms, such as kinetic or potential energy, with different properties
and formulas to remember. For instance, an LED desk lamp's 6 Watt bulb transfers 6 Joules
of light energy per second. But let's jump back up into space to look at our planet,
its systems, and their energy flow. Earth's physical systems include the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere. Energy moves in and out of these systems, and during any energy
transfer between them, some is lost to the surroundings, as heat, light, sound, vibration, or movement. Our planet's energy comes from
internal and external sources. Geothermal energy
from radioactive isotopes and rotational energy
from the spinning of the Earth are internal sources of energy, while the Sun
is the major external source, driving certain systems,
like our weather and climate. Sunlight warms the surface and atmosphere
in varying amounts, and this causes convection, producing winds
and influencing ocean currents. Infrared radiation, radiating out
from the warmed surface of the Earth, gets trapped by greenhouse gases
and further affects the energy flow. The Sun is also the major source
of energy for organisms. Plants, algae, and cyanobacteria use sunlight to produce organic matter from carbon dioxide and water, powering the biosphere's food chains. We release this food energy
using chemical reactions, like combustion and respiration. At each level in a food chain,
some energy is stored in newly made chemical structures, but most is lost to the surroundings, as heat, like your body heat, released by your digestion of food. Now, as plants are eaten
by primary consumers, only about 10% of their total energy
is passed on to the next level. Since energy can only flow
in one direction in a food chain, from producers on to consumers
and decomposers, an organism that eats lower
on the food chain, is more efficient than one higher up. So eating producers
is the most efficient level at which an animal can get its energy, but without continual input of energy
to those producers, mostly from sunlight, life on Earth as we know it
would cease to exist. We humans, of course, spend our energy
doing a lot of things besides eating. We travel, we build, we power
all sorts of technology. To do all this, we use sources like fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas, which contain energy that plants captured
from sunlight long ago and stored in the form of carbon. When we burn fossil fuels in power plants, we release this stored energy to generate electricity. To generate electricity, heat from burning fossil fuels
is used to power turbines that rotate magnets, which, in turn, create
magnetic field changes relative to a coil of wire, causing electrons to be
induced to flow in the wire. Modern civilization depends on our ability to keep powering that flow of electrons. Fortunately, we aren't limited
to burning non-renewable fossil fuels to generate electricity. Electrons can also be induced to flow by direct interaction
with light particles, which is how a solar cell operates. Other renewable energy sources, such as wind, water, geothermal, and biofuels can also be used to generate electricity. Global demand for energy is increasing, but the planet
has limited energy resources to access through a complex
energy infrastructure. As populations rise, alongside rates of industrialization
and development, our energy decisions grow
more and more important. Access to energy
impacts health, education, political power, and socioeconomic status. If we improve our energy efficiency, we can use our natural resources
more responsibly and improve quality of life for everyone.","Energy is a physical quantity that follows natural laws and can take different forms.

60,60,4Vfn5CV9juI,How to speak monkey: The language of cotton-top tamarins - Anne Savage,"Living with her family high above the ground in the northern tropical forests of Colombia, you will find Shakira, a cotton-top tamarin with a penchant for conversation. Say, ""Hola!"" Though you may not realize it, this one pound monkey communicates in a highly sophisticated language of 38 distinct calls based on variations of chirps and whistles. The response she just gave is known as a ""B chirp"", a call often directed at humans. To appreciate the complexities of Shakira's language, let's learn a few chirps and whistles, then examine how their combinations form grammatically structured sequences. The chirp Shakira used to greet us comes from a class of calls known as single frequency modulated syllables. This class is made up of short duration calls, or chirps, and long duration calls, like screams and squeals. Researchers have determined that there are eight different types of chirps categorized by stem upsweep, duration, peak frequency, and frequency change. In addition, each chirp has its own unique meaning. For example, Shakira's ""C chirp"" is used when she is approaching food, where as her ""D chirp"" is only used when she has the food in hand. Single whistles also exhibit a unique intention with each call and just as there are eight different chirps, there are five different whistles. Based on frequency modulation, single whistles are subdivided into four categories: squeaks, initially modulated whistles, terminally modulated whistles, and flat whistles. The language's quality of unique intention is wonderfully exemplified by the category of initially modulated whistles. These whistles change based on the proximity of Shakira to other members of her family. If Shakira is greater than .6 meters from her family, she'll sound a large initally modulated whistle. But if she's less than .6 meters from her family, she'll sound a small initially modulated whistle. Now that we've learned a few chirps and whistles, Shakira wants to show off by taking you through a quick day in her life with these calls. While heading towards a feeding tree for her first meal of the day, she says, (monkey noise), a call most often used in relaxed investigations. However, suddenly she spots the shadow of a hawk. ""E chirp"" for alarm. This call alerts her family to the presence of this predator, and Shakira jumps to the safety of an inner branch. The coast seems clear, so Shakira makes her way towards her dad. Wait, wait. Who is that? Ah, it's her younger brother, Carlos. Cotton-top tamarins often squeal during play wrestling. Uh-oh. He's playing a little too roughly, and Shakira screams, alerting her parents to help her. Her dad makes his way towards the ball of rolling fur and her brother stops. Shakira shakes herself and scratches herself to get the hair on her head back in place. Then Shakira spots another group of unfamiliar tamarins and hears their normal long call. She turns to her family. (Monkey noise) Did you catch that? First there was a chirp, then a whistle. This is what's known as a combination vocalization, a phrase that contains both a chirp and a whistle. These are two calls strung together to convey a message. The combination of these two elements alerts her family to the presence of another group, the ""F chirp"", and the distance they are away, the normal long call whistle. In other words, Shakira just said a sentence. Her simple demonstration is just the tip of the iceberg. She's got trills, chatters, multiple whistle calls, more combination vocalizations, even twitters. Yet sadly enough, we may not get to hear everything she has to say. Mixed in with chirping sonatas from high above is the constant thud of a machete chopping trees. Shakira's habitat in Colombia is being cut down, piece by piece, and if we don't work to protect the critically endangered cotton-top tamarin, it will become extinct in our lifetime. If the chirp from one tamarin to the next has proven to be more than just idle chit chat, imagine what else we have left to discover. Imagine what else Shakira can tell us.","Shakira, a cotton-top tamarin, communicates using a sophisticated language of 38 distinct calls based on chirps and whistles.

61,61,Vd4rgN6MYtg,Attack of the killer algae - Eric Noel Muñoz,"We've all seen the movies where a monster, created by a scientist in a laboratory, escapes to wreak havoc on the outside world. But what if the monster was not some giant rampaging beast, destroying a city, but just a tiny amount of seaweed with the potential to disrupt entire coastal ecosystems? This is the story of Caulerpa taxifolia, originally a naturally occurring seaweed native to tropical waters. In the 1980s, one strain was found to thrive in colder environments. This trait, combined with its beautiful, bright green color and ability to grow quickly without maintenance made it ideal for aquariums, which it helped keep clean by consuming nutrients and chemicals in the water. Further selective breeding made it even heartier, and soon it was used in aquariums around the world. But it was not long before a sample of this aquarium-developed super algae turned up in the Mediterranean Sea near the famed Oceanographic Museum of Monaco. The marine biologist who found it believed that the museum had accidentally realeased it into the ocean along with aquarium waters, while museum directors claimed it had be carried into the area by ocean currents. Regardless of how it ended up there, the non-native Caulerpa multiplied rapidly, having no natural predators due to releasing a toxin that keeps fish away. And like some mythical monster, even a tiny piece that broke off could grow into a whole new colony. Through water currents and contact with boat anchors and fishing lines, it fragmented and spread throughout Mediterranean coastal cities covering coral reefs. So what was the result of this invasion? Well, it depends on who you ask. Many scientists warned that the spread of Caulerpa reduces biodiversity by crowding out native species of seaweed that are eaten by fish, with the biologist who first discovered its presence dubbing it Killer Algae. Other studies instead claim that the algae actually had a beneficial effect by consuming chemical pollutants -- one reason the aquariums strain was developed. But the disruption of a natural ecosystem by an introduced foreign species can have unpredictable and uncontrollable effects that may not be immediately visible. So when Culerpa taxifolia was discovered at Carlsbad's Agua Hedionda Lagoon, near San Diego in the year 2000, having most likely come from the dumping of home aquarium water into a connecting storm drain, it was decided to stop it before it spread. Tarps were placed over the Culerpa colonies and chlorine injected inside. Although this method killed all other marine life trapped under the tarps, it did succeed in eradicating the algae and native eelgrass was able to emerge in its place. By responding quickly, authorities in California were able to prevent Culerpa from propagating. But another occurrence of the strain, in the coastal wetlands of southeast Australia, was left unchecked and allowed to spread. And unfortunately, a tarp cannot cover the Mediterranean Sea or the Australian coast. Invasive species are not a new problem, and can indeed occur naturally. But when such species are the results of human directed selective breeding or genetic modification and then released into the natural environment, their effect on ecosystems can be far more radical and irreversible. With the proliferation of new technologies and multiple threats to the environment, it is more important than ever for scientists to monitor and evaluate the risks and dangers, and for the rest of us to remember that what starts in our backyard can effect ecosystems half a world away.","The video talks about Caulerpa taxifolia, a type of seaweed that was originally found in tropical waters but was later bred to thrive in colder environments. This seaweed was used in aquariums worldwide due to its ability to keep the water clean. However, a sample of this seaweed was accidentally released into the Mediterranean Sea in the 1980s and began to spread rapidly, covering coral reefs and reducing biodiversity. The seaweed releases a toxin that keeps fish away, making it difficult for natural predators to control its spread.

62,62,Y5uRVv7GGQM,How bees help plants have sex - Fernanda S. Valdovinos,"Bees are very busy little matchmakers. Wingmen in every sense of the word. You see, the bees' side of the whole ""birds and the bees"" business is to help plants find mates and reproduce. In their work as pollinators, honeybees are integral to the production of nearly 1/3 of the food that we eat. And these bees, dutifully helping lonely plants have sex, aren't alone. But rather are part of a very complex network of matchmaking creatures, critical for the pollination of natural ecosystems and crops. Plants in many natural ecosystems need help to have sex. Like many of us, they're too busy to find a relationship. They have too much photosynthesis to do, and they can't find the time to evolve feet and walk to a singles bar. Those places are called meat markets for a reason, because plants can't walk. So they need matchmaker pollinators to transport their pollen grains to flowers of the same plant species, and they pay these pollinators with food. Today, around 170,000 plant species receive pollination services from more than 200,000 pollinator species. Pollinators include many species of bees, butterflies, moths, flies, wasps, beetles, even birds and bats, who together help pollinate many species of trees, shrubs and other flowering plants. In return, flowering plants are an abundant and diverse food source for pollinators. For instance, fossil records suggest bees may have evolved from wasps that gave up hunting after they acquired a taste for nectar. Plant pollinator networks are everywhere. Ecologists record these networks in the field by observing which pollinators visit which plants, or by analyzing the identity of pollen loads on their bodies. Networks, registered in these ways, contain from 20 to 800 species. These networks show a repeated structure, or architecture. Pollinators interact with plants in a very heterogenous way. Most plants are specialists, they have only one or a few matchmakers. Meanwhile, only a few generalist plants hire a diverse team of matchmakers, getting visits from almost all the pollinators of the network. The same occurs with pollinators. Most are specialists that feed on only a few plant species, while a few pollinators, including the honeybee usually, are generalists, busily feeding from and matchmaking for almost all the plant species in that ecosystem. What's interesting is that specialists and generalists across both plants and pollinators, sort themselves out in a particular pattern. Most pollinator networks, for which we have data, are nested. In a nested network, specialists tend to interact more with generalists than with other specialists. This is because if you're a specialist plant, and your only matchmaker also specializes on you as its only food source, you're each more vulnerable to extinction. So, you're better off specializing on a generalist pollinator that has other sources of food to ensure its persistence in bad years. The same goes if you're a specialist pollinator. You're better off in the long run specializing on a generalist plant that gets pollinated by other species in times when you're not around to help. Finally, in addition to nestedness, the networks are usually modular. This means that the species in a network are compartmentalized into modules of plants and animals that interact more with each other than with species in other modules. Think of them like social cliques. A plant or pollinator dying off will effect the species in its module, but those effects will be less severe on the rest of the network. Why's all that important? Because plant pollinator network structure effects the stability of ecosystems. Heterogeneous distribution, nestedness and modularity enable networks to better prevent and respond to extinctions. That's critical because nature is never static. Some species may not show up every year. Plants flower at different times. Pollinators mature on varying schedules. Generalist pollinators have to adapt their preferences depending on who's flowering when. So from one flowering season to the next, the participants and patterns of matchmaking can drastically change. With all those variables, you can understand the importance of generalist pollinators, like bees, to the stability of not only a crop harvest, but the entire network of plants and pollinators we see in nature, and rely on for life. Next time you see a bee fly by, remember that it belongs to a complex network of matchmakers critical to the love lives of plants all around you.","Bees are matchmakers for plants, helping them reproduce by transporting pollen grains to flowers of the same plant species. This is called pollination, and it's crucial for the production of nearly 1/3 of the food that we eat. Bees are not alone in this task, as many other species of insects, birds, and bats also help pollinate plants. In return, flowering plants provide food for pollinators. The relationship between plants and pollinators forms complex networks, with most plants and pollinators being specialists and a few being generalists. These networks are nested and modular, which helps prevent and respond to extinctions. Generalist pollinators, like bees, are essential for the stability of not only crop harvests but also natural ecosystems."
63,63,hDNlu7Qf6_E,The colossal consequences of supervolcanoes - Alex Gendler,"The year was 1816. Europe and North America had just been through a devastating series of wars, and a slow recovery seemed to be underway, but nature had other plans. After two years of poor harvests, the spring brought heavy rains and cold, flooding the rivers and causing crop failures from the British Isles to Switzerland. While odd-colored snow fell in Italy and Hungary, famine, food riots and disease epidemics ensued. Meanwhile, New England was blanketed by a strange fog that would not disperse as the ground remained frozen well into June. In what came to be known as ""the Year Without a Summer,"" some thought the apocalypse had begun. A mood captured in Lord Byron's poem ""Darkness"": ""I had a dream which was not all a dream. The bright sun was extinguish'd, and the stars did wander darkling in the eternal space, rayless, and pathless, and the icy Earth swung blind and blackening in the moonless air; morn came and went -- and came, and brought no day."" They had no way of knowing that the real source of their misfortunes had occurred a year ago thousands of miles away. The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora on the Indonesian island of Sumbawa was what is known as a supervolcano, characterized by a volume of erupted material, many times greater than that of ordinary volcanoes. And while the popular image of volcanic destruction is molten rock engulfing the surrounding land, far greater devastation is caused by what remains in the air. Volcanic ash, dispersed by wind, can blanket the sky for days, while toxic gases, such as sulfur dioxide, react in the stratosphere, blocking out solar radiation and drastically cooling the atmosphere below. The resulting volcanic winter, along with other effects such as acid rain, can effect multiple continents, disrupting natural cycles and annihilating the plant life on which other organisms, including humans, depend. Releasing nearly 160 cubic kilometers of rock, ash and gas, the Mount Tambora eruption was the largest in recorded history, causing as many as 90,000 deaths. But previous eruptions have been even more deadly. The 1600 eruption of Peru's Huaynaputina is likely to have triggered the Russian famine, that killed nearly two million, while more ancient eruptions have been blamed for major world events, such as the fall of the Chinese Xia Dynasty, the disappearance of the Minoan civilization, and even a genetic bottleneck in human evolution that may have resulted from all but a few thousand human beings being wiped out 70,000 years ago. One of the most dangerous types of supervolcano is an explosive caldera, formed when a volcanic mountain collapses after an eruption so large that the now-empty magma chamber can no longer support its weight. But though the above-ground volcano is gone, the underground volcanic activity continues. With no method of release, magma and volcanic gases continue to accumulate and expand underground, building up pressure until a massive and violent explosion becomes inevitable. And one of the largest active volcanic calderas lies right under Yellowstone National Park. The last time it erupted, 650,000 years ago, it covered much of North America in nearly two meters of ash and rock. Scientists are currently monitoring the world's active volcanoes, and procedures for predicting eruptions, conducting evacuations and diverting lava flows have improved over the years. But the massive scale and global reach of a supervolcano means that for many people there would be nowhere to run. Fortunately, the current data shows no evidence of such an eruption occurring in the next few thousand years. But the idea of a sudden and unavoidable civilization-destroying apocalypse caused by events half a globe away will remain a powerful and terrifying vision. Less fictional than we would like to believe. ""The winds were withered in the stagnant air, and the clouds perish'd; darkness had no need of aid from them -- she was the universe."" - Lord Byron","The video talks about supervolcanoes, which are volcanoes that erupt with a volume of material many times greater than ordinary volcanoes. The most dangerous type of supervolcano is an explosive caldera, which forms when a volcanic mountain collapses after a massive eruption. The video mentions the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia, which caused a ""year without a summer"" in Europe and North America. It also mentions the Yellowstone National Park caldera in the United States, which last erupted 650,000 years ago and covered much of North America in ash and rock. The video concludes by saying that scientists are currently monitoring the world's active volcanoes, and procedures for predicting eruptions and conducting evacuations have improved. However, the massive scale and global reach of a supervolcano mean that for many people, there would be nowhere to run."
64,64,3drtbPZF9yc,The science of symmetry - Colm Kelleher,"When you hear the word symmetry, maybe you picture a simple geometric shape like a square or a triangle, or the complex pattern on a butterfly's wings. If you are artistically inclined, you might think of the subtle modulations of a Mozart concerto, or the effortless poise of a prima ballerina. When used in every day life, the word symmetry represents vague notions of beauty, harmony and balance. In math and science, symmetry has a different, and very specific, meaning. In this technical sense, a symmetry is the property of an object. Pretty much any type of object can have symmetry, from tangible things like butterflies, to abstract entities like geometric shapes. So, what does it mean for an object to be symmetric? Here's the definition: a symmetry is a transformation that leaves that object unchanged. Okay, that sounds a bit abstract, so let's unpack it. It will help to look at a particular example, like this equilateral triangle. If we rotate our triangle through 120 degrees, around an access through its center, we end up with a triangle that's identical to the original. In this case, the object is the triangle, and the transformation that leaves the object unchanged is rotation through 120 degrees. So we can say an equilateral triangle is symmetric with respect to rotations of 120 degrees around its center. If we rotated the triangle by, say, 90 degrees instead, the rotated triangle would look different to the original. In other words, an equilateral triangle is not symmetric with respect to rotations of 90 degrees around its center. But why do mathematicians and scientists care about symmetries? Turns out, they're essential in many fields of math and science. Let's take a close look at one example: symmetry in biology. You might have noticed that there's a very familiar kind of symmetry we haven't mentioned yet: the symmetry of the right and left sides of the human body. The transformation that gives this symmetry is reflection by an imaginary mirror that slices vertically through the body. Biologists call this bilateral symmetry. As with all symmetries found in living things, it's only approximate, but still a striking feature of the human body. We humans aren't the only bilaterally symmetric organisms. Many other animals, foxes, sharks, beetles, that butterfly we mentioned earlier, have this kind of symmetry, as do some plants like orchid flowers. Other organisms have different symmetries, ones that only become apparent when you rotate the organism around its center point. It's a lot like the rotational symmetry of the triangle we watched earlier. But when it occurs in animals, this kind of symmetry is known as radial symmetry. For instance, some sea urchins and starfish have pentaradial or five-fold symmetry, that is, symmetry with respect to rotations of 72 degrees around their center. This symmetry also appears in plants, as you can see for yourself by slicing through an apple horizontally. Some jellyfish are symmetric with respect to rotations of 90 degrees, while sea anemones are symmetric when you rotate them at any angle. Some corals, on the other hand, have no symmetry at all. They are completely asymmetric. But why do organisms exhibit these different symmetries? Does body symmetry tell us anything about an animal's lifestyle? Let's look at one particular group: bilaterally symmetric animals. In this camp, we have foxes, beetles, sharks, butterflies, and, of course, humans. The thing that unites bilaterally symmetric animals is that their bodies are designed around movement. If you want to pick one direction and move that way, it helps to have a front end where you can group your sensory organs-- your eyes, ears and nose. It helps to have your mouth there too since you're more likely to run into food or enemies from this end. You're probably familiar with a name for a group of organs, plus a mouth, mounted on the front of an animal's body. It's called a head. Having a head leads naturally to the development of bilateral symmetry. And it also helps you build streamlined fins if you're a fish, aerodynamic wings if you're a bird, or well coordinated legs for running if you're a fox. But, what does this all have to do with evolution? Turns out, biologists can use these various body symmetries to figure out which animals are related to which. For instance, we saw that starfish and sea urchins have five-fold symmetry. But really what we should have said was adult starfish and sea urchins. In their larval stage, they're bilateral, just like us humans. For biologists, this is strong evidence that we're more closely related to starfish than we are, to say, corals, or other animals that don't exhibit bilateral symmetry at any stage in their development. One of the most fascinating and important problems in biology is reconstructing the tree of life, discovering when and how the different branches diverged. Thinking about something as simple as body symmetry can help us dig far into our evolutionary past and understand where we, as a species, have come from.","Symmetry in math and science means an object's property that remains unchanged after a transformation. For example, an equilateral triangle is symmetric when rotated 120 degrees around its center. Symmetry is crucial in many scientific fields, including biology. Animals and plants can have different types of symmetry, like bilateral or radial. Bilateral symmetry, like in humans, is common in moving organisms, as it helps them have a front end with sensory organs and a mouth. Biologists use body symmetry to understand animal relationships and evolution. For instance, starfish and humans share a bilateral larval stage, suggesting a closer evolutionary relationship than with corals.

65,65,Wx9vPv-T51I,How tsunamis work - Alex Gendler,"In 479 BC, when Persian soldiers besieged the Greek city of Potidaea, the tide retreated
much farther than usual, leaving a convenient invasion route. But this wasn't a stroke of luck. Before they had crossed halfway, the water returned in a wave higher
than anyone had ever seen, drowning the attackers. The Potiidaeans believed
they had been saved by the wrath of Poseidon. But what really saved them was likely the same phenomenon
that has destroyed countless others: a tsunami. Although tsunamis are commonly
known as tidal waves, they're actually unrelated
to the tidal activity caused by the gravitational forces
of the Sun and Moon. In many ways, tsunamis are just
larger versions of regular waves. They have a trough and a crest, and consist not of moving water, but the movement of energy through water. The difference is
in where this energy comes from. For normal ocean waves,
it comes from wind. Because this only affects the surface,
the waves are limited in size and speed. But tsunamis are caused by energy
originating underwater, from a volcanic eruption, a submarine landslide, or most commonly,
an earthquake on the ocean floor caused when the tectonic plates
of the Earth's surface slip, releasing a massive amount
of energy into the water. This energy travels up to the surface, displacing water and raising it above
the normal sea level, but gravity pulls it back down, which makes the energy ripple
outwards horizontally. Thus, the tsunami is born, moving at over 500 miles per hour. When it's far from shore,
a tsunami can be barely detectable since it moves through
the entire depth of the water. But when it reaches shallow water,
something called wave shoaling occurs. Because there is less water
to move through, this still massive amount
of energy is compressed. The wave's speed slows down, while its height rises
to as much as 100 feet. The word tsunami,
Japanese for ""harbor wave,"" comes from the fact that it only seems
to appear near the coast. If the trough of a tsunami
reaches shore first, the water will withdraw
farther than normal before the wave hits, which can be misleadingly dangerous. A tsunami will not only drown
people near the coast, but level buildings and trees
for a mile inland or more, especially in low-lying areas. As if that weren't enough,
the water then retreats, dragging with it the newly created debris, and anything, or anyone,
unfortunate enough to be caught in its path. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was one of the deadliest
natural disasters in history, killing over 200,000 people
throughout South Asia. So how can we protect ourselves
against this destructive force of nature? People in some areas have attempted to stop tsunamis
with sea walls, flood gates, and channels to divert the water. But these are not always effective. In 2011, a tsunami
surpassed the flood wall protecting Japan's Fukushima Power Plant, causing a nuclear disaster in addition to claiming over 18,000 lives. Many scientists and policy makers
are instead focusing on early detection, monitoring underwater pressure
and seismic activity, and establishing global
communication networks for quickly distributing alerts. When nature is too powerful to stop, the safest course
is to get out of its way.","---
Tsunamis are not tidal waves, but massive waves caused by underwater energy from earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or landslides. They move at 500 miles per hour and can reach 100 feet high. When they reach shallow water, wave shoaling occurs, slowing the wave and increasing its height. Tsunamis can drown people near the coast, level buildings, and drag debris inland. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami killed over 200,000 people. Protection methods include sea walls, flood gates, and channels, but early detection and global communication networks are more effective.

Hey there! Did you know that tsunamis are not tidal waves, but massive waves caused by underwater energy? They can move at 500 miles per hour and reach 100 feet high! When they reach shallow water, they can slow down and become even bigger. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was one of the deadliest natural disasters in history, killing over 200,000 people.

66,66,0UzMaoaXKaM,Nature's smallest factory: The Calvin cycle - Cathy Symington,"You're facing a giant bowl of energy packed Carbon Crunchies. One spoonful. Two. Three. Soon, you're powered up by the energy surge that comes from your meal. But how did that energy get into your bowl? Energy exists in the form of sugars made by the plant your cereal came from, like wheat or corn. As you can see, carbon is the chemical backbone, and plants get their fix of it in the form of carbon dioxide, CO2, from the air that we all breath. But how does a plant's energy factory, housed in the stroma of the chloroplast, turn a one carbon gas, like CO2, into a six carbon solid, like glucose? If you're thinking photosynthesis, you're right. But photosynthesis is divided into two steps. The first, which stores energy from the sun in the form of adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. And the second, the Calvin cycle, that captures carbon and turns it into sugar. This second phase represents one of nature's most sustainable production lines. And so with that, welcome to world's most miniscule factory. The starting materials? A mix of CO2 molecules from the air, and preassembled molecules called ribulose biphosphate, or RuBP, each containing five carbons. The initiator? An industrious enzyme named rubisco that welds one carbon atom from a CO2 molecule with the RuBP chain to build an initial six carbon sequence. That rapidly splits into two shorter chains containing three carbons each and called phosphoglycerates, or PGAs, for short. Enter ATP, and another chemical called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, or just NADPH. ATP, working like a lubricant, delivers energy, while NADPH affixes one hydrogen to each of the PGA chains, changing them into molecules called glyceraldehyde 3 phosphates, or G3Ps. Glucose needs six carbons to form, made from two molecules of G3P, which incidentally have six carbons between them. So, sugar has just been manufactured, right? Not quite. The Calvin cycle works like a sustainable production line, meaning that those original RuBPs that kicked things off at the start, need to be recreated by reusing materials within the cycle now. But each RuBP needs five carbons and manufacturing glucose takes a whole six. Something doesn't add up. The answer lies in one phenomenal fact. While we've been focusing on this single production line, five others have been happening at the same time. With six conveyor belts moving in unison, there isn't just one carbon that gets soldered to one RuBP chain, but six carbons soldered to six RuBPs. That creates 12 G3P chains instead of just two, meaning that all together, 36 carbons exist: the precise number needed to manufacture sugar, and rebuild those RuBPs. Of the 12 G3Ps pooled together, two are siphoned off to form that energy rich six carbon glucose chain. The one fueling you via your breakfast. Success! But back on the manufacturing line, the byproducts of this sugar production are swiftly assembled to recreate those six RuBPs. That requires 30 carbons, the exact number contained by the remaining 10 G3PS. Now a molecular mix and match occurs. Two of the G3Ps are welded together forming a six carbon sequence. By adding a third G3P, a nine carbon chain is built. The first RuBP, made up of five carbons, is cast from this, leaving four carbons behind. But there's no wastage here. Those are soldered to a fourth G3P molecule, making a seven carbon chain. Added to a fifth G3P molecule, a ten carbon chain is created, enough now to craft two more RuBPs. With three full RuBPs recreated from five of the ten G3Ps, simply duplicating this process will renew the six RuBP chains needed to restart the cycle again. So the Calvin cycle generates the precise number of elements and processes required to keep this biochemical production line turning endlessly. And it's just one of the 100s of cycles present in nature. Why so many? Because if biological production processes were linear, they wouldn't be nearly as efficient or successful at using energy to manufacture the materials that nature relies upon, like sugar. Cycles create vital feedback loops that repeatedly reuse and rebuild ingredients crafting as much as possible out of the planet's available resources. Such as that sugar, built using raw sunlight and carbon converted in plant factories to become the energy that powers you and keeps the cycles revolving in your own life.","The Calvin cycle is the second phase of photosynthesis, where plants turn carbon dioxide into sugar. It's a sustainable production line that takes place in the chloroplasts of plant cells. The cycle starts with an enzyme called rubisco, which attaches carbon dioxide to a five-carbon molecule called RuBP. The resulting six-carbon molecule quickly splits into two three-carbon molecules called PGAs. ATP and NADPH provide energy and hydrogen to convert PGAs into G3Ps. Two G3Ps combine to form glucose, while the remaining G3Ps are used to recreate RuBPs. The cycle is efficient because it creates a feedback loop that reuses and rebuilds ingredients, allowing plants to manufacture sugar using raw sunlight and carbon dioxide."
67,67,t3I9gDocYdk,From the top of the food chain down: Rewilding our world - George Monbiot,"We all know about the dinosaurs that once roamed the planet, but long after they went extinct, great beasts we call the megafauna lived on every continent. In the Americas, ground sloths the size of elephants pulled down trees with their claws. Saber-toothed cats the size of brown bears hunted in packs, but they were no match for short-faced bears, which stood thirteen feet on their hind legs, and are likely to have driven these cats away from their prey. There were armadillos as big as small cars, an eight foot beaver, and a bird with a 26 foot wingspan. Almost everywhere, the world's megafauna were driven to extinction, often by human hunters. Some species still survive in parts of Africa and Asia. In other places, you can still see the legacy of these great beasts. Most trees are able to resprout where their trunk is broken to withstand the loss of much of their bark and to survive splitting, twisting and trampling, partly because they evolved to survive attacks by elephants. The American pronghorn can run so fast because it evolved to escape the American cheetah. The surviving animals live in ghost ecosystems adapted to threats from species that no longer exist. Today, it may be possible to resurrect those ghosts, to bring back lost species using genetic material. For instance, there's been research in to cloning woolly mammoths from frozen remains. But even if it's not possible, we can still restore many of the ecosystems the world has lost. How? By making use of abandoned farms. As the market for food is globalized, infertile land becomes uncompetitive. Farmers in barren places can't compete with people growing crops on better land elsewhere. As a result, farming has started to retreat from many regions, and trees have started to return. One estimate claims that two-thirds of land in the US that was once forested but was cleared for farming has become forested again. Another estimate suggests that by 2030, an area in Europe the size of Poland will be vaccated by farmers. So even if we can't use DNA to bring back ground sloths and giant armadillos, we can restore bears, wolves, pumas lynx, moose and bison to the places where they used to live. Some of these animals can reshape their surroundings, creating conditions that allow other species to thrive. When wolves were reintroduced to the Yellowstone National Park in 1995, they quickly transformed the ecosystem. Where they reduced the numbers of overpopulated deer, vegetation began to recover. The height of some trees quintupled in just six years. As forests returned, so did songbirds. Beavers, which eat trees, multiplied in the rivers, and their dams provided homes for otters, muskrats, ducks, frogs and fish. The wolves killed coyotes, allowing rabbits and mice to increase, providing more food for hawks, weasels, foxes and badgers. Bald eagles and ravens fed on the carrion that the wolves abandoned. So did bears, which also ate the berries on the returning shrubs. Bison numbers rose as they browsed the revitalized forests. The wolves changed almost everything. This is an example of a trophic cascade, a change at the top of the food chain that tumbles all the way to the bottom, affecting every level. The discovery of widespread trophic cascades may be one of the most exciting scientific findings of the past half century. They tell us that ecosystems that have lost just one or two species of large animals can behave in radically different ways from those that retain them. All over the world, new movements are trying to catalyze the restoration of nature in a process called rewilding. This means undoing some of the damage we've caused, reestablishing species which have been driven out, and then stepping back. There is no attempt to create an ideal ecosystem, to produce a heath, a rainforest or a coral reef. Rewilding is about bringing back the species that drive dynamic processes and then letting nature take its course. But it's essential that rewilding must never be used as an excuse to push people off the land. It should happen only with the consent and enthusiasm of the people who work there. Imagine standing on a cliff in England, watching sperm whales attacking shoals of herring as they did within sight of the shore until the 18th century. By creating marine reserves in which no commerical fishing takes place, that can happen again. Imagine a European Serengeti full of the animals that used to live there: hippos, rhinos, elephants, hyenas and lions. What rewilding reintroduces, alongside the missing animals and plants, is that rare species called hope. It tells us that ecological change need not always proceed in the same direction. The silent spring could be followed by a wild summer.","The video talks about the megafauna that once roamed the planet and how they were driven to extinction.

68,68,KnJ4_xRfxpA,Poison vs. venom: What's the difference? - Rose Eveleth,"Would you rather be bitten by a venomous snake or touch a poisonous frog? Wait, what's the difference between poison and venom, anyway? Let's say you have the misfortune to be bitten by a venomous rattlesnake. When it bites you, the snake will eject venom from little sacks behind its eyes, through its hollow fangs and into your flesh. That venom will then travel through your bloodstream and all over your body. In most cases, snake venom contains neurotoxins, proteins that can do all sorts of nasty stuff like make your muscles fire uncontrollably, burst your blood cells, and make you go completely numb. But you might get lucky! Snakes don't always decide you're worth wasting venom on. In fact, between 20 and 80% of snake bites are so-called ""dry bites,"" where the snake is just trying to send a message without actually killing you. You see, venom takes energy and resources for the snake to make, and they don't want to waste it on a warning shot. When it comes to poison, on the other hand, there's no warning shot. If you pick up a poisonous dart frog to admire its beautiful colors, you've already gotten deadly poison all over your hands. As it seeps into your skin and travels through your blood, the poison starts to interfere with your nerves, preventing your muscles from contracting. If the frog's poison reaches your heart, it can cause it to stop. The distinction between venom and poison is purely in the method of delivery. Poison has to be inhaled, ingested, or absorbed. Venom has to be injected into a wound. Chemically, venoms and poisons are both considered toxins, so a snake bite is venomous. A poison dart frog is poisonous. Brown recluse spiders are venomous. Lionfish and pufferfish are poisonous. And some compounds can be poisons in one animal and venoms in another. Tetrodotoxin, a chemical 10,000 times more toxic than cyanide, is found in pufferfish, where it makes them poisonous. It's also found in the deadly blue-ringed octopus, where it's a venom delivered by bite. Some animals can even be both poisonous and venomous. Take the Asian tiger snake, for example. Not only does it have venom in its fangs but it also absorbs the toxins from the poisonous toads it eats, and then secretes those toxins from special glands on its neck, rendering it poisonous, too. Scientists are constantly finding new animals that employ toxins in weird, interesting ways. Recently, researchers discovered the very first venomous crustacean. Out of 70,000 species of crustaceans, only this one little remipede is venomous. Speleonectes tulumensis has figured out how to create a cocktail of toxins that it delivers through its tiny fangs. Scientists aren't totally sure how this venom works yet, but they think that it causes the unwitting victims' neurons to fire over and over and over again until it becomes paralyzed. Then, the little remipede closes in, dissolving away the exoskeleton of its prey and sucking out the juices. But poisons and venoms aren't always all bad. For thousands of years, humans have looked for ways to harness the power of these toxic compounds for good. Today, we have all sorts of medicines that come from toxins. The poison from cone snails is used as a painkiller. Many poisonous plants have been used to treat everything from malaria to irregular heartbeats. And scorpion venom might one day be used to treat heart disease. So, what should you do if something bites or poisons you? Don't try any of the things you've seen on the internet or in movies! Don't try to capture and kill the animal that bit you, and don't use a tourniquet or knife on your wound. Most importantly, don't panic! Stay calm, and seek medical attention. Treatment will mostly depend on what species you encountered. But if you forget the distinction between poison and venom, and tell the parademics that you were poisoned by a viper, they'll probably forgive you and treat you anyway.","The difference between poison and venom lies in the method of delivery. Poison is inhaled, ingested, or absorbed, while venom is injected into a wound. Venomous creatures, like snakes, inject venom through hollow fangs, while poisonous ones, like dart frogs, secrete poison through their skin. Some animals, like the Asian tiger snake, can be both poisonous and venomous. Toxins from poisonous and venomous creatures have been used for medicinal purposes for thousands of years, such as painkillers, treatments for malaria and irregular heartbeats, and potential treatments for heart disease. If bitten or poisoned, seek medical attention immediately and do not panic.

Curious facts:

* Venom is injected into a wound, while poison is inhaled, ingested, or absorbed.
* Snake venom contains neurotoxins that can cause muscles to fire uncontrollably, burst blood cells, and make you go numb.
* Between 20 and 80% of snake bites are ""dry bites,"" where the snake is just trying to send a message without actually killing you.
* Poison dart frogs secrete poison through their skin, which can interfere with nerves and prevent muscles from contracting.
* Some animals, like the Asian tiger snake, can be both poisonous and venomous.
* Toxins from poisonous and venomous creatures have been used for medicinal purposes for thousands of years.
* If bitten or poisoned, seek medical attention immediately and do not panic."
69,69,p-vNSqUy0l4,The Pangaea Pop-up - Michael Molina,"Once upon a time, South America lived harmoniously alongside Africa until a crack in the Earth drove the two continents apart. This breakup began about 200 million years ago during the separation of the supercontinent known as Pangaea. Their proximity back then explains why the same plant fossils and reptile fossils, like the Mesosaurus, can be found on the South American east coast and African west coast. However, this evidence does not account for how the continents moved apart. For that, we'll need to take a close look at the earth below our feet. Though you may not realize it, the ground below you is traveling across the Earth at a rate of about 10 cm/year, or the speed at which your fingernails grow. This is due to plate tectonics, or the large-scale movement of Earth's continents. The motion occurs within the top two layers of the Earth's mantle, the lithosphere and asthenosphere. The lithosphere, which includes the crust and uppermost mantle, comprises the land around you. Beneath the lithosphere is the asthenosphere the highly viscous but solid rock portion of the upper mantle. It's between 80 and 200 km below the Earth's surface. While the asthenosphere wraps around the Earth's core as one connected region, the lithosphere is separated on top into tectonic plates. There are seven primary tectonic plates that compose the shape of the planet we know today. Like the other smaller tectonic plates, the primary plates are about 100 km thick and are composed of one or two layers: continental crust and oceanic crust. Continental crust forms the continents and areas of shallow water close to their shores, whereas oceanic crust forms the ocean basins. The transition from the granitic continental crust to the basaltic oceanic crust occurs beyond the continentel shelf, in which the shore suddenly slopes down towards the ocean floor. The South American Plate is an example of a tectonic plate made of two crusts: the continent we know from today's map and a large region of the Atlantic Ocean around it. Collectively comprising the lithosphere, these plates are brittler and stiffer than the heated, malleable layer of the asthenosphere below. Because of this, the tectonic plates float on top of this layer, independently of one another. The speed and direction in which these tectonic plates move depends on the temperature and pressure of the asthenosphere below. Scientists are still trying to nail down the driving forces behind this movement, with some theories pointing towards mantle convection, while others are examining the influence of the Earth's rotation and gravitational pull. Though the mechanics have not been sorted out, the scientific community agrees that our tectonic plates are moving and have been for billions of years. Because these plates move independently, a fair amount of pushing and pulling between the plates occurs. The first type of interaction is a divergent boundary, in which two plates move away from one another. We see this in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between South America and Africa. The next interaction is when two plates collide, known as a convergent boundary. In this instance, the land is pushed upward to form large mountain ranges, like the Himalayas. In fact, the Indian Plate is still colliding with the Eurasian Plate, which is why Mount Everest grows one cm/year. Finally, there's the transform boundaries, where two plates scrape past one another. The grinding of the transform boundary leads to many earthquakes, which is what happens in the 810 mile-long San Andreas Fault. The moving Earth is unstoppable, and, while a shift of 10 cm/year may not seem like a lot, over millions of years our planet will continue to dramatically change. Mountains will rise, shorelines will recede, islands will pop up. In fact, one projected map shows the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco on top of each other. Maybe South America and Africa will come together again, too. Only time will tell.","The video explains how the continents were once joined together in a supercontinent called Pangaea. The separation of Pangaea began 200 million years ago due to plate tectonics, where Earth's continents move independently on top of the asthenosphere, a highly viscous but solid rock portion of the upper mantle. The movement of the tectonic plates is due to the temperature and pressure of the asthenosphere, with theories pointing towards mantle convection, Earth's rotation, and gravitational pull. The video also describes the three types of interactions between the tectonic plates: divergent, convergent, and transform boundaries. The movement of the Earth's tectonic plates is unstoppable, leading to dramatic changes in the planet's landscape over millions of years.

70,70,yDIQzUSezmA,How to fossilize...yourself - Phoebe A. Cohen,"Imagine being a fossil: touring the world's great museums, inspiring awe in onlookers of all ages, posing for hordes of fawning photographers. Sound like something you'd like? Well, good luck! At least 99.9% of creatures that have ever lived aren't preserved in the fossil record. But forget about them, everyone else will, and listen up! If you want your corpse in the exclusive 0.01% Club, the Hall of Preserved Fossil Fame, it will not be easy. You better work! Step one: die. It's a cold, hard fact of fossilization. Everything paleontologists find was once alive and, at some point, died. We'll skip the details and assume you had a long, fulfilling life so we can get to what is really important -- how you die. There are many ways to become a fossil, so let's highlight your top death options. You could get yourself trapped in tree sap, which, when hardens, turns into amber and can survive intact for millions of years. But unless you find a really big tree to sit under, amber preservation will likely remain the domain of insects and other very small animals. Generally, the right place to be if you want to end up a fossil is wherever sediment is actively being deposited, like a lake or an ocean floor. A mountaintop or prairie? Not good! You need to get buried, the faster the better, because the longer you hang around on the surface, the more likely you'll get eaten, scavenged, or otherwise destroyed before ever having a chance to get preserved. If you can get buried someplace with little to no oxygen, like a bog or a deep lake bottom, even better. That lack of oxygen will slow down your decay and give you more time to fossilize. So, let's say you're lucky enough to die and get buried in a shallow sea under muddy, sandy sediments. What's your next move? One option is a process called permineralization. While all your soft parts decay away, your bones get saturated with mineral-rich waters. Bit by bit, microscopic crystals precipitate out of these waters to fill in the empty spaces and pores in your bones. Otherwise, you'd better hope the sediments around you harden while your bones decay away and another sediment or mineral fills in the spaces your bones leave behind, creating a perfect cast of your skeleton. Over time, the sediments around your fossil will lithify or turn into rock. But you're not in the clear yet! Many things could happen to those sedimentary rocks that might destroy your chances of getting discovered. They could get uplifted into a mountain range and eroded away or carried along in an oceanic plate and subducted back into the Earth's mantle, melting your fossil into hot mush. Fingers crossed your rock surroundings will get gently lifted up by plate tectonics, sea levels will change, and you'll end up under dry land close to the surface, but not so close that erosion from wind and rain wipes you away before someone can come find you. The last step in this long process, an intrepid paleontologist has to come find you. Maybe she's a research scientist scouting for fossils your age and type or just an amateur collector hoping for a fortuitous find. She whacks away at layers of rock above you or spots your fossil exposed in a creek bank after a flood. And there you are, a magnificent scientific discovery, millions of years in the making! She and her colleagues gently extract you from the surrounding sediment, measure and photograph all the bits and pieces they find, and begin the complex task of reconstructing how and when you lived based on the evidence they find in your bones. Paleontologists will be some of your biggest fans along with all those admiring crowds at the museum. You made it! You spent years underground in obscurity, shedding blood, sweat, tears, and your internal organs. You worked yourself to the bone until your bones disintegrated and were replaced by minerals and sediments. But it was all worth it because you're a famous fossil! Now, you better hold that pose!","Fossilization is a rare occurrence, with only 0.01% of all living beings making it into the fossil record. To become a fossil, you must first die and then get buried quickly in a sediment-rich area, ideally with little to no oxygen. The two main processes of fossilization are permineralization, where mineral-rich waters replace your bones, and cast formation, where sediment or minerals fill in the spaces left by your decaying bones. After millions of years, your fossil may be discovered by a paleontologist, who will study and preserve it for scientific research and public display."
71,71,kGhknFzrnXg,"The popularity, plight and poop of penguins - Dyan deNapoli","Penguins have long captured the imagination and the hearts of people the world over. But while popular culture depicts them as clumsy, adorable birds with endlessly abundant populations, the truth is that penguins are exceedingly graceful, often ornery, and their populations are in rapid free fall. Their real life situation is far more precarious than people think. And if current trends do not change, it may not be long before penguins can only be found in movies. There are many things about penguins that make them odd birds, so to speak. For one thing, they are one of the few bird species that cannot fly, having evolved from flight-capable birds about 60 million years ago. Surprisingly, their closest living relative is the albatross, a bird known for its enormous wingspan and extraordinary soaring abilities. It may seem strange that losing the ability to fly would be an evolutionary advantage, but the penguin's short, flipper-like wings and solid bones allow them to swim faster and dive deeper than any other bird on Earth, filling an ecological niche that no other bird can. Penguins inhabit the southern hemisphere, being one of the few bird species able to breed in the coldest environments. But contrary to popular belief, they are not restricted to cold regions nor are there any at the North Pole. In fact, only 4 of the 18 penguin species regularly live and breed in Antarctica. Most penguins live in subtemperate to temperate regions. And the Galapagos penguin even lives and breeds right near the equator off the coast of South America. They are also found in South Africa, Namibia, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as on a number of islands in the southern Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Antarctic Oceans. Although penguins spend 75% of their lives at sea, they must come to shore every year to reproduce and to molt their feathers. They do this in a variety of places, from the temporary ice sheets of the Antarctic to the beaches of South Africa and Namibia, to the rocky shores of subantarctic islands, to the craggy lava surfaces in the Galapagos. Different penguin species have different nesting practices. Some dig burrows into dirt, sand, or dried guano; some nest in tussock grasses; some build nests out of small rocks, sticks, and bones; while others don't build any nests at all. Although most penguins lay a clutch of two eggs, the two largest species, the King and the Emperor, lay a single egg that they incubate on top of their feet for approximately two months. Unfortunately, 15 of the 18 penguin species are currently listed as threatened, near-threatened, or endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In the last several decades, we have seen the world populations of most penguin species decline by up to 90%, with two of them, the Yellow-eyed and Galapagos penguins, down to just a few thousand birds. Penguins are an indicator species, the proverbial ""canary in the coal mine."" Simply put, if penguins are dying, it means our oceans are dying. And sadly, most of this decline is attributable to human activities. Historically, penguins have had to deal with multiple disturbances. The mass collection of penguin eggs and the harvesting of the seabird guano they nested in caused the dramatic decline of several penguin species. If you're wondering what humans would want with seabird poop, it was used as an ingredient in fertilizer and in gunpowder, being so valuable that in the 19th century, it was known as white gold. Current threats to penguins include the destruction of both marine and terrestrial habitats, introduced predators, entrapment in fishing nets, and pollution from plastics and chemicals. There have also been several large-scale oil spills over the past 50 years that have killed or impacted tens of thousands of penguins around the world. But the two major threats to penguins today are global warming and overfishing. Global warming impacts penguins in multiple ways, from interrupting the production of krill due to decreased sea ice formation in the Antarctic, to increasing the frequency and severity of storms that destroy nests, to shifting the cold water currents carrying the penguins' prey too far away from penguin breeding and foraging grounds. Even though humans may be the greatest threat to penguins, we are also their greatest hope. Many research and conservation projects are underway to protect penguin habitats and restore vulnerable populations. With a little help from us and some changes in the practices that impact our planet and oceans, there is hope that our tuxedo-clad friends will still be around in the next century.","Penguins are fascinating creatures, but they are not as abundant as people think.

72,72,IkmjCmvfeFI,"The loathsome, lethal mosquito - Rose Eveleth","What's the worst bug on the planet? You might vote for the horsefly
or perhaps the wasp, but for many people, the worst offender is by far the mosquito. The buzzing, the biting, the itching, the mosquito is one of the most commonly
detested pests in the world. In Alaska, swarms
of mosquitos can get so thick that they actually asphyxiate caribou. And mosquito-borne diseases
kill millions of people every year. The scourge
that is the mosquito isn't new. Mosquitoes have been around
for over a hundred million years and over that time have coevolved
with all sorts of species, including our own. There are actually thousands
of species of mosquitos in the world, but they all share one insidious quality: they suck blood, and they're really, really
good at sucking blood. Here's how they do it. After landing, a mosquito will slather some saliva onto the victim's skin,
which works like an antiseptic, numbing the spot so we don't
notice their attack. This is what causes the itchy,
red bumps, by the way. Then the bug will use
its serrated mandibles to carve a little hole in your skin, allowing it to probe around
with its proboscis, searching for a blood vessel. When it hits one,
the lucky parasite can suck two to three times its weight in blood. Turns out we don't really
like that too much. In fact, humans hate mosquitos so much that we spend billions
of dollars worldwide to keep them away from us -- from citronella candles to bug sprays to heavy-duty
agricultural pesticides. But it's not just
that mosquitos are annoying, they're also deadly. Mosquitos can transmit everything
from malaria to yellow fever to West Nile virus to dengue. Over a million people worldwide die every year
from mosquito-borne diseases, and that's just people. Horses, dogs, cats, they can all get diseases
from mosquitoes too. So, if these bugs are so dastardly,
why don't we just get rid of them? We are humans after all, and we're pretty good
at getting rid of species. Well, it's not quite so simple. Getting rid of the mosquito
removes a food source for lots of organisms,
like frogs and fish and birds. Without them,
plants would lose a pollinator. But some scientists say that mosquitos aren't
actually all that important. If we got rid of them, they argue, another species would simply
take their place and we'd probably have far
fewer deaths from malaria. The problem is that nobody
knows what would happen if we killed off all the mosquitos. Something better might take their spot or perhaps something even worse. The question is,
are we willing to take that risk?

73,73,Q-mMMpl_T80,"Bird migration, a perilous journey - Alyssa Klavans","Each spring, nature lovers eagerly greet the signs that winter is finally coming to an end. As the days grow warmer, the flowers and trees start to bloom, and the world comes alive with the melodious call of birds in search of a new mate. But where have these enchanting sounds been hiding all winter? For almost 200 species of song birds, their winters have been spent down in the tropical climates of Central and South America. While this may sound ideal, it involves one of the most perilous journeys known in the entire animal kingdom. This journey is called migration, and for song birds, this can involve travelling somewhere between a few hundred to almost 7,000 miles in a period of several weeks to four months. Birds spend weeks preparing for the intense journey by gorging on large quantities of food, sometimes doubling their weight prior to departure. While flying, birds can lose almost one percent of their body weight an hour, so packing on the pounds is crucial to their survival. However, more than the physical stress, migrating birds are now facing a new source of hardship: landscape change. Just imagine you're the one getting ready to take a trip. You've packed the car with everything you think you need, fueled up the tank, eaten a huge breakfast, and hit the road. You've taken this journey before. You know all your favorite rest stops and little back-alley diners to grab a bite. Everything is planned out. But just as your fuel gauge starts dipping into the red zone, you pass by what should have been a gas station, except it's closed. ""Not a problem,"" you think, ""The next one can't be too far away."" But then that next station never appears. Unfortunately, as you continue on your route, the reality of the situation starts to set in. More and more stations are closed or just erased from your map. All of a sudden, your routine trip has become a desperate search just to find somewhere safe to rest and refuel for the night. This scenario has become the reality for the majority of migrating song birds as human land development continues unchecked. Humans are altering important stop-over sites that birds have been using for generations. As migrators pass over the continent, they run a gauntlet of dangers, including pesticide ingestion in rural farmlands, habitat loss in suburban developments, as well as disorientation from light pollution, and even structure collision with tall, reflective glass buildings in cities. Of the estimated 20 billion individual birds that comprise the fall population, only about half will return to breed the following spring. Almost one billion of these deaths are attributed just to building collisions. With such astounding yearly losses, humans risk more than just the loss of the beautiful colors and songs of birds, they also play an important role in the ecosystem. Birds help with insect control, pollination, and disbursing seeds throughout the landscape. Without birds, the natural world would be a very different place. Although birds face an on-going threat from human land development, there are actions that we can all take to help. Many countries and local governements have already passed important laws that restrict the use of poisonous pesticides. By using more natural, plant-based products, we can maintain our farms and gardens without the dangerous side effects. In addition, as our global populations continue to grow and people need places to call home, green spaces can offer both bird habitat as well as a peaceful and natural place for us to enjoy. Small changes at home can also make a huge difference. By hanging up feeders and building bird houses in outdoor areas, we can provide much-needed food and safety during long migrations. Turning out lights in suburban and urban environments can also help birds that look for stars to navigate. With our help, these sky travellers can reach their destination safely, and hopefully keep returning year after year.","Birds migrate from Central and South America to North America in spring, traveling up to 7,000 miles in a few weeks to four months. They prepare by eating a lot to double their weight. However, they face many dangers, including pesticide ingestion, habitat loss, light pollution, and building collisions. Half of the estimated 20 billion birds that migrate don't return the following spring, with almost one billion deaths from building collisions alone. Birds play an essential role in the ecosystem, controlling insects, pollinating, and dispersing seeds. We can help by using natural pesticides, preserving green spaces, providing food and shelter, and turning off lights in urban environments."
74,74,8iaoEkpnvVk,Cicadas: The dormant army beneath your feet - Rose Eveleth,"If you live on the east coast
of the United States, you've spent the last
17 years of your life walking, eating and sleeping above a dormant army of insects. These are the cicadas. Every 17 years, billions of them emerge
from the ground to do three things: molt, mate and die. There are 15 different broods
of cicadas out there, grouped by when they'll emerge
from the ground. Some of these broods
are on a 13-year cycle, others are on a 17-year clock. Either way, the cicadas live underground
for most of their lives, feeding on the juices of plant roots. When it's time to emerge, the adults begin to burrow
their way out of the ground and up to the surface, where they'll live for just a few weeks. During these weeks, though, everybody will know
the cicadas have arrived. There will be billions of them. And they're loud. Male cicadas band together
to call for female mates, and their collective chorus
can reach up to 100 decibels -- as loud as a chain saw. In fact, if you happen to be using
a chain saw or a lawn mower, male cicadas will flock to you, thinking that you're one of them. Now, like most things in nature, the cicadas don't arrive without a posse. There are all sort of awesome
and gross predators and parasites that come along with the buzzing bugs. Take the fungus Massospora for example. This little white fungus buries itself
in the cicada's abdomen and eats the bug alive, leaving behind its spores. When those spores rupture, they burst out of the still-alive cicada, turning the bug into a flying
saltshaker of death, raining spores down upon
its unsuspecting cicada neighbors. But while we know pretty precisely when the cicadas will arrive
and fade away, we're still not totally certain of why. There are certain advantages to having your entire species
emerge at once, of course. The sheer number of cicadas
coming out of the ground is so overwhelming to predators,
it is essentially guaranteed that a few bugs will survive
and reproduce. And since cicadas emerge
every 13 or 17 years, longer than the lifespan
of many of their predators, the animals that eat them don't learn
to depend on their availability. But why 13 and 17 years, instead of 16 or 18 or 12? Well, that part no one really knows. It's possible the number
just happened by chance, or, perhaps, cicadas
really love prime numbers. Eventually, the cicadas
will mate and slowly die off, their call fading into the distance. The eggs they lay
will begin the cycle again, their cicada babies burrowing
into the earth, feeding on plant juice, and waiting for their turn
to darken the skies and fill the air with their songs. In 17 years, they'll be ready. Will you?","Cicadas are insects that live underground for 13 or 17 years, depending on their brood.

75,75,Z5VRoGTF60s,The Arctic vs. the Antarctic - Camille Seaman,"On our planet, we have two polar regions: the Arctic, whose name comes from the Greek Arktikos, of the North, and the Antarctic from Antarktikos, opposite of the North. But there's an easier way to remember them if you just remember what surrounds them. The Arctic, situated in the Northern hemisphere of our planet, is an ocean entirely surrounded by land. On the other side of the world, the Antarctic is a continent entirely surrounded by ocean. So, the Arctic has polar bears but no penguins, and the Antarctic has penguins but no polar bears. Let's talk about the Arctic first. The Arctic region consists of a vast, ice-covered ocean surrounded by treeless permafrost. The area can be defined as the region between the Arctic Circle and the North Pole. If you were to stand at the North Pole, everywhere you looked, in all directions, would be south. But standing at the North Pole is difficult to do for very long because it's in the middle of an ocean, covered by constantly shifting, frozen sea ice. If you were to fall into the water at the North Pole, you'd fall into water that's 13,980 feet deep. Above the water, average winter temperatures can be as low as -40 degrees Celsius, and the coldest recorded temperature is approximately -68 degrees Celsius. Despite these incredibly harsh conditions, humans have populated areas in the Arctic for thousands of years. Life in the Arctic includes organisms living in the ice, zooplankton and phytoplankton, fish and marine mammals, birds, land animals, plants, and human societies. Okay, what about Antarctica? Antarctica is Earth's southernmost continent, and it contains the geographic South Pole. It's the fifth largest continent on the planet at nearly twice the size of Australia. Almost 98% of Anarctica is covered by ice at least one mile in thickness. Conditions in Antarctica are some of the most extreme in the entire world. On average, it's the coldest, windiest, driest continent and has the highest average elevation of all the continents. You might think that it snows all the time at the Poles, but Antarctica is so dry, it's considered a desert with annual precipitation of only 200 millimeters along the coast and far less inland. The temperature in Antarctica has reached -89 degrees Celsius. Because it's so harsh and hard to get to, there are no permanent human residents on Antarctica, but anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at the research stations scattered across the continent. Even the most extreme animals fight for survival, and only cold-adapted organisms survive there, including many types of algae, animals, bacteria, fungi, plants, and protista. But why is Antarctica colder than its northern cousin? Well, first, much of the continent is more than three kilometers above sea level, and temperature decreases with elevation. That's why mountaintops have snow on them. Second, remember that the Arctic is really a frozen ocean. The water in the ocean beneath it is warmer than the frozen ground in the Antarctic, and that warmth is transferred through the ice pack. This prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica. Third, the seasons are conspiring against the Antarctic. During the aphelion in July, when the Earth is the farthest away from the Sun, it also happens to be winter in the Antarctic, which creates a double-whammy of cold for the southern pole. But despite being inhospitable, the North and South Pole are a big reason why our planet is the way it is. Both of our polar regions are very important climate controllers. They help moderate the temperature in our temperate zones and give us stable weather. As sea ice in the Arctic declines due to climate change and global warming, weather around the globe becomes increasing more unstable.","The Arctic and Antarctic are Earth's polar regions, with the Arctic in the Northern hemisphere and the Antarctic in the Southern hemisphere. The Arctic is an ocean surrounded by land, while the Antarctic is a continent surrounded by ocean. The Arctic has polar bears but no penguins, and the Antarctic has penguins but no polar bears. The Arctic is home to treeless permafrost and harsh winter conditions, while the Antarctic is the coldest, windiest, driest continent with the highest average elevation. Despite extreme conditions, both regions host various organisms, including humans, who have adapted to survive. Climate change and global warming are causing sea ice in the Arctic to decline, leading to unstable weather worldwide."
76,76,-PPGe7MU6ME,What's below the tip of the iceberg? - Camille Seaman,"Have you ever heard the term, ""tip of the iceberg""? You know that icebergs
are mostly underwater, their immense bulk hidden
beneath the water. But why is that so? Well, the density of pure ice is less than that of sea water. Usually only 1/9
of the volume of an iceberg is above the water. The shape of the underwater portion is difficult to discern by looking at the above-surface portion. This has led to the expression, ""tip of the iceberg."" Here are some thing you might not know about the icy islands. The life of an iceberg begins many thousands of years before it reaches the ocean. Unlike sea ice or pack ice, which form when the ocean freezes, glaciers are made of fresh water. For thousands of years, these glaciers build
layer upon layer of ice, constantly compressing, moving, adding snow, compressing, and moving again as they inch along like a frozen river. It is the force of gravity that pulls them towards the sea, where a glacier may calve
off to become an iceberg or continue to spread up as an ice shelf or an ice tongue. Once an iceberg breaks away from the glacier or ice shelf, it will usually live
for three to six years, floating around, carried by the currents and tidal movements of the ocean. As it floats along, it is battered by waves, melts, and smashes into land and sometimes other icebergs. Some icebergs are so unstable that they have more dramatic ends, heaving up, collapsing, and sometimes even exploding. And as they fall apart, many icebergs make all sorts
of strange sounds. When a piece of iceberg melts, it makes a fizzing sound, called Bergie Seltzer. This sound is made when
the water-ice interface reaches compressed air
bubbles trapped in the ice. As this happens, each bubble bursts, making a popping sound. There are six official size
classifications for icebergs. The smallest icebergs are called growlers. They can be up the size of your car and are very dangerous for ships and boats because usually they sit
just at the waterline where they are not easy to spot. Next are the bergy bits - yes, that is their scientific name - which can be up to the size of your home. The other four sizes are small, medium, large, and very large. So just how big is a very large iceberg? Officially, any iceberg looming larger than 270 feet high above sea level and 670 feet long is considered very large. That's 27 stories of looming, blue ice. And how do icebergs get
that blue color anyways? When snow on the glacier is compressed over many hundreds of years, the weight of the snow forces the air bubbles out of the ice, creating pure ice with very
little air trapped inside. This compression is seen when the glacier calves, creating a blue iceberg. An iceberg that has not experienced as much compression and has a large amount
of air and surface edges reflects light as white. Although they form in far
northern or southern areas, icebergs can float thousands of miles. An iceberg from the Arctic floated as far south as Bermuda. Antarctic icebergs are mostly trapped in the Circumpolar Current, never giving them a chance to float north. However, they have been known to interrupt shipping lanes between Australia, South America, and South Africa. For all their travelling, many people think that these slabs of ice
are barren of life, but these seemingly sterile ice slabs also harbor their own complex ecosystems and they shape the ecosystems that they pass through. They become mobile, floating ecosystems. Even in the coldest seas, icebergs are always melting, at least a little bit. This melting has a major impact on the ocean around an iceberg. The fresh water from the berg creates a pool of fresh water that can extend a nautical
mile away from the iceberg. This water is colder
than the surrounding sea water, and the temperature variation
creates thermal currents in the vicinity of the iceberg. Life thrives on and around an iceberg. Young icefish hide in small
ice holes to avoid predators, while a variety of invertebrates, like jellyfish and siphonophores, congregate in the area. Many of them come to feed on krill, tiny shrimp-like creatures. Snow petrels nest on the icebergs and feed on the sea life nearby. Whales and seals and penguins
seem to like them too. And even now that you know all this, we're still at the tip of the iceberg. There are all sorts of things we don't know about icebergs. Perhaps you'll be
the one to see a little deeper.","Icebergs are mostly underwater, with only 1/9 of their volume above the surface. They start as glaciers, made of fresh water, that move towards the sea due to gravity.

There are six official size classifications for icebergs, with very large icebergs being over 270 feet high and 670 feet long. Icebergs get their blue color from the absence of air bubbles due to compression. They can travel thousands of miles and harbor their own ecosystems, impacting the surrounding ocean life. Despite knowing a lot about icebergs, there's still more to discover."
77,77,9zmB3Gx3e_s,"Got seeds? Just add bleach, acid and sandpaper - Mary Koga","So, the apocalypse has happened. The zombies have come and gone, and all plant life
on Earth has died somehow. All you have are some basic supplies and some seeds of a few types
of essential plants. So, what should you do to make absolutely sure they grow, seeing how rebuilding human civilization absolutely depends on it? Well, you'd probably think the last thing you should do with these crucially important seeds is something like poking holes in them, or grinding them with sandpaper, or throwing them in acid or hot water. But, in fact, all of these are methods that are commonly used to help seeds start growing. A typical seed consists of a plant embryo encased in a hard seed coat. To start growing, it needs to emerge or sprout from inside this shell. This process is called germination. But just as it would be hard for you to get out of a jail cell with no windows and no doors, the embryo might need a little help escaping from its seed prison, and any process that makes this easier by wearing down the seed coat is called scarification. This lets moisture and nutrients get through the seed coat, making the embryo start growing until it breaks through. Now, you might be wondering why it is that plants would need humans to do all these weird
things to their seeds in order to grow, and, in fact, they don't. In natural environments, seed coats are worn
down by cold temperatures, bacteria, or even animal digestion. Our scarification methods just mimick and accelerate these natural processes to increase the chances
of successful germination. One technique we can
use is called nicking. To do this, we make a small cut or scratch into the seed coat. Be careful not to cut too deep! You don't want to damage
the plant embryo inside. Another way is to file down the seed coat using sandpaper or a nail file. Once again, you don't
want to file too much, just enough to wear
down some of the seed coat. After applying either of these methods, you'll want to spray the seeds with bleach to prevent mold. Seeds can also be soaked in water to soften the coat. One way to do this is to place the seeds in a nylon bag, then place the bag into hot water. Turn off the heat immediately and allow the water to cool
to room temperature before removing the seeds. It's important not to heat
the seed for too long as this will kill the embryo. Again, you'll want to spray them with bleach afterwards. Finally, you can try immersing the seeds in a sulfuric acid solution. Make sure you're wearing
protective goggles and gloves any time you work with such
a dangerous substance. Place the seeds into a wire mesh pouch and immerse the pouch
in the solution for ten minutes. Then take out the pouch and rinse it with clean water. Take out the seeds and, as before, spray them with bleach
so they don't get moldy. If you try all of these methods, you will see that some of them are more effective than others, and some work best
for different types of plants that have harder or thicker coats. So, knowing what seed scarification
techniques work best will be useful if you ever
need to survive a cataclysm, start a farm, or just want to plant in your own garden.","The video explains how to help seeds grow in case of an apocalypse. The process is called scarification, which involves wearing down the seed coat to let moisture and nutrients in. This can be done by making small cuts or scratches, filing down the seed coat with sandpaper, soaking in hot water, or immersing in a sulfuric acid solution. These methods mimic natural processes like cold temperatures, bacteria, or animal digestion. After scarification, seeds should be sprayed with bleach to prevent mold. Different techniques work better for different types of seeds, so it's essential to know which ones work best. This knowledge can be helpful not only in a post-apocalyptic scenario but also in everyday gardening.

78,78,mZt1Gn0R22Q,Myths and misconceptions about evolution - Alex Gendler,"Myths and misconceptions about evolution. Let's talk about evolution. You've probably heard that some people consider
it controversial, even though most scientists don't. But even if you aren't one of those people and you think you have a pretty
good understanding of evolution, chances are you still believe
some things about it that aren't entirely right, things like, ""Evolution is organisms
adapting to their environment."" This was an earlier, now discredited, theory of evolution. Almost 60 years before Darwin
published his book, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed that creatures evolve by developing certain traits over their lifetimes and then passing those
on to their offspring. For example, he thought that because giraffes spent their lives stretching to reach leaves
on higher branches, their children would be
born with longer necks. But we know now that's not
how genetic inheritance works. In fact, individual organisms
don't evolve at all. Instead, random genetic mutations cause some giraffes to be
born with longer necks, and that gives them
a better chance to survive than the ones who weren't so lucky, which brings us to ""survival of the fittest"". This makes it sound
like evolution always favors the biggest, strongest, or fastest creatures, which is not really the case. For one thing, evolutionary
fitness is just a matter of how well-suited
they are to their current environment. If all the tall trees suddenly died out and only short grass was left, all those long-necked giraffes would be at a disadvantage. Secondly, survival is not
how evolution occurs, reproduction is. And the world if full of creatures like the male anglerfish, which is so small and ill-suited
for survival at birth that it has to quickly find
a mate before it dies. But at least we can say that if an organism dies
without reproducing, it's evolutionarily useless, right? Wrong! Remember, natural selection happens not at the organism level, but at the genetic level, and the same gene
that exists in one organism will also exist in its relatives. So, a gene that makes an animal
altruistically sacrifice itself to help the survival
and future reproduction of its siblings or cousins, can become more widespread than one that is solely concerned
with self-preservation. Anything that lets more copies of the gene pass on to the next generation will serve its purpose, except evolutionary purpose. One of the most difficult things
to keep in mind about evolution is that when we say things like, ""Genes want to make more
copies of themselves,"" or even, ""natural selection,"" we're actually using metaphors. A gene doesn't want anything, and there's no outside mechanism that selects which genes
are best to preserve. All that happens is that random
genetic mutations cause the organisms carrying them to behave or develop in different ways. Some of those ways result in more copies of the mutated gene being passed on, and so forth. Nor is there any predetermined plan progressing towards an ideal form. It's not ideal for the human
eye to have a blind spot where the optic nerve exits the retina, but that's how it developed, starting from a simple photoreceptor cell. In retrospect, it would have been much more advantageous for humans to crave nutrients and vitamins rather than just calories. But over the millenia, during which our ancestors evolved, calories were scarce, and there was nothing to anticipate that this would later change so quickly. So, evolution proceeds blindly, step by step by step, creating all of the diversity
we see in the natural world.","Evolution is a fascinating topic, but there are many misconceptions about it. For instance, evolution is not about organisms adapting to their environment. Instead, it's about random genetic mutations that give some organisms an advantage in their environment, allowing them to survive and reproduce more effectively. The phrase ""survival of the fittest"" is misleading because evolution is not just about survival, but also about reproduction. Moreover, evolution doesn't always favor the biggest, strongest, or fastest creatures. Sometimes, genes that promote altruistic behavior can become more widespread, even if the organism carrying them doesn't survive. Ultimately, evolution is a blind process that creates diversity in the natural world.

79,79,V8miLevRI_o,Vermicomposting: How worms can reduce our waste - Matthew Ross,"Think of all the food made
in the world each year. Hard to picture? Then, imagine that you
are all of humanity, and on a plate in front of you is the one lovely annual
meal you make for yourself. You did all sorts of work putting
that meal on your table. You must be eager to consume
the fruits of your labor. And the vegetables and meats and waffles of your labor, too, right? Well, oddly enough, a third of that meal ends up in the trash. A third of the food we eat globally, an estimated 1.3 billion tons ends up as waste. All the work we put into producing
that food is wasted. And what's worse, it costs us. America alone spends an estimated 165 billion dollars a year managing food waste. We're wasting food, energy, and money. Perhaps worst of all, we're wasting the chance to change, to make the system of food
consumption more efficient. If you want to bring on that change, you should know about a humble yet diligent and ever-so-crucial ally: the worm. Worms convert organic waste and other compostable products
into natural fertilizers. Up to 75% of what we put
in the waste stream can become food and bedding material for vermicomposting. You can create a worm bin in your own home to see the composting process in action. First off, you need worms and not your typical earthworms. You need redworms, eisenia foetida, the species responsible for most vermicomposting in North America. These red wigglers are surface dwellers who don't burrow too deep, they're optimal feeders
around room temperature, and they're well-suited
to converting organic waste into usable fertilizer. Now, your worms might be vermin, but they need a comfortable
space to live and work: some bedding materials, either shredded paper or cardboard, some moisture, and, of course, food, mainly, your leftovers, slightly decomposed table scraps. The worms break down food waste and other organic matter into castings, a fancy synonym for worm poop. Their excrement is absolutely
teeming with microbes, which continue the decomposition process, making all those once-wasted nutrients available again as fertilizer. The timeline for the whole process varies depending on the quantity of worms, the temperature, and how much waste is added to the bin. And there's another timeline to consider. In a healthy worm-bin habitat, worm reproduction will occur when the wigglers become sexually mature, indicated by an elongation of the segments into a bulbous structure. Three-month old wigglers can produce two to three semi-translucent
yellow worm cocoons a week. You thought only moths and butterflies come out of cocoons? Well, we can't all be majestic. It takes around 11 weeks
for new babies to hatch. When your bin seems to be full
of living vermicelli noodles, it's time to share
the bounty with your friends and start a vermicompost club. Or keep those worms to yourself and start a business. Vermicomposting isn't confined only to small worm bins, it's an emerging
entrepreneurial enterprise. Large-scale facilities convert bulk organic waste and even manure into rich, black castings
called black gold. Its value as a soil
additive is unparalleled, and it can help plants
resist harmful pathogens. The lack of available land
in urban environments, coupled with growing interest
in smaller-scale farming means there is a market
for vermicomposting. Many communities use composting as part of zero-waste strategies, and they can sell
their worm-eaten table scraps to local farms, hungry
for rich fertilizer. So, instead of wasting money, dumping wasted food in landfills, we can remake waste into an asset, putting it back into our food system to make it more sustainable, all with the help of the humble worm, the tiny organism that can help us change the way we look
at food's place in our lives and our place in the world, as long as we give the little guy a place at our table. Well, not an actual seat at the table. A bin in the shed is fine.","Did you know that a third of the food we produce globally ends up in the trash? That's 1.3 billion tons of food waste! This costs us money and energy, and it's also bad for the environment. But there's a solution: vermicomposting! Vermicomposting is the process of using worms to convert organic waste into natural fertilizers. Redworms, also known as red wigglers, are the best species for this job. They break down food waste and other organic matter into castings, which are full of microbes that continue the decomposition process. These castings make a great fertilizer for plants. Vermicomposting can be done on a small or large scale, and it's a great way to reduce food waste and create a more sustainable food system."
80,80,Qq0kMEWzdHg,The game-changing amniotic egg - April Tucker,"Would you believe that walruses, rattlesnakes, and parakeets all once lived in the same house? Let's go back about 350 million years. Look around. Steamy swamps and rain forests
of horsetails and ferns cover the region. Amphibians are the dominant
land vertebrates. They range in size from newts to crocodiles. And all require water
to do their egg laying. If they don't go to the water, their shell-less, jelly-like
eggs will dry out. Because of this hazard, they spend most of their time living in or near fresh water. That is, until a breakthrough in evolution changes everything: the amniotic egg. The amniotic egg is shelled, waterproof, and can be laid on dry land. It is produced by the amniotes, a new group of animals named
after their revolutionary egg. The first amniote is a tetrapod, a four-legged animal, resembling a small lizard. While some amphibians
can walk around on land and bury their eggs in wet
soil or highly humid areas, nothing before the amniotes
has the ability to lay its eggs on completely dry land. Because of this evolved egg, the amniotes are the first animals with the ability to live
a fully terrestrial life. But, despite their move inland, the amniotes have not abandoned their pond-dwelling upbringing. In fact, the amniotic egg
brings the pond with them by enclosing the aquatic
environment within its shell. This is achieved by four main upgrades that are unique to amniotic eggs. Let's take a closer look. The first development is the most obvious: the egg's protective shell. It's tough but flexible, and has a leathery surface, still seen in reptile eggs today. The shell protects
the eggs from predators, bacteria, damage, and drying out. But, unlike the walls of a fish tank, the shell of the amniotic egg is porous, allowing oxygen to pass through so that the growing amniote
inside doesn't suffocate. The next two developments
are two separate membranes that work together like a pair of lungs. They bring oxygen into the embryo while removing carbon dioxide. The first is the chorion, which is the protective layer
that oxygen passes through after entering the shell's tiny pores. You may recognize the chorion as the thin skin you peel
away on a hard boiled egg. Think of this waterproof membrane as the in and out doors of the egg. It's the entrance for oxygen and exit for carbon dioxide. The membrane working with the chorion is the allantois. If the chorion is the doors, then the allantois is essentially
the lobby of the building. It directs the oxygen and carbon dioxide while simultaneously storing unneeded waste from the embryo. The chorion and the allantois
make sure the embryo has everything it needs and gets rid of anything it doesn't. The last and perhaps
the most important development is the amnion, the membrane
for which the egg is named. The amnion is also contained
within the chroion and holds the fluid
in which the embryo floats. Because it has left the watery
world of the amphibians, the amnion is necessary for preventing the embryo from drying out. It is the transportable pond that allows the amniote
to lay the egg on dry land. Its fluid also protects the embryo from any collisions or rough landings, like a shock absorber on your bike or car. Together, the shell
and these four membranes create a safe, watery environment for the embryo to grow and develop. The new amniote offspring will continue the process of vertebrate evolution as it explores new land
away from the water. They will spend the next million years splitting into two distinct groups: the synapsids and sauropsids. Synapsida is the group of animals that contain mammals, while sauropsida
is the group that contains reptiles, birds, and dinosaurs. These two amniotic groups
collectively contain the walruses, rattlesnakes, and parakeets we know today. Like a family reunion, with relatives of every shape and size, coming together from different
corners of the Earth, these animals can all call one place home: the amniotic egg.","The amniotic egg is a game-changer in evolution, allowing animals to live on dry land. This egg has a protective shell and four membranes that work together to protect the embryo and provide it with oxygen and water. The amniotic egg is named after the amnion, a membrane that holds the fluid in which the embryo floats, allowing it to grow and develop on dry land. The amniotes, the first animals to lay this egg, eventually split into two groups: synapsids (mammals) and sauropsids (reptiles, birds, and dinosaurs). The amniotic egg allowed these animals to explore new habitats and evolve into various shapes and sizes."
81,81,mW1xBc1dwqI,Tracking grizzly bears from space - David Laskin,"Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby These are grizzly bears. As you can see, they have big teeth and giant claws. But once you get to know them better, they're not as ferocious as you might think. They play a critical role in the function of our ecosystems, but, unfortunately, their habitat is dwindling fast. In order to protect them, it's important to know why do grizzlies choose certain areas to inhabit in the first place? Let's look at a threatened population of bears living in the rocky mountains of Canada. Remember those giant claws? Well, they're not for what you might think. They have evolved specifically for digging up energy-rich roots. It turns out that grizzlies eat a lot of plants. The ones that live here are almost vegetarians. You see, unlike other predators, grizzlies have diverse diets that can include up to 90% vegetation. However, maintaining a diet of plants can be difficult. In these northern latitudes, you have distinct seasons where it's really nice and green for part of the year and really cold for the other part. If you eat plants, you have almost nothing to eat for the cold part of the year. So, you either have to migrate like geese or hibernate like ground squirrels. Grizzly bears hibernate. Their behaviors are closely synchronized with the seasons. During the summer, they have to pack on enough body fat to survive the winter. Without it, they would either starve or not have enough energy to successfully produce offspring. But when you eat mostly plants, it's hard to gain a lot of weight. You need to be a highly effective forager. So, bears tightly follow the schedule of the plants and harvest them like crops at the point in time when they are at the most nutritious. This will happen in different places at different times. In autumn, a large male grizzly can eat up to 200,000 berries in a single day. Therefore, to protect these bears, researchers want to take a closer look at the seasonal interaction between grizzlies and plants to identify areas of the highest quality habitat. This begins 700 kilometers up in space. Up here, two NASA satellites carry sensors that are sensitive to the light reflected by vegetation. Every species of plant reflects a unique combination of wave lengths, called spectral signatures that act like different chords on a piano but use light instead of sound. These signatures are recorded by the satellites every day and are combined like frames in a movie so you can watch the vegetation grow over an entire summer. Simultaneously, the movements of bears wearing GPS collars are monitored to see how they respond to the ebb and flow of nutrition throughout their habitat. Now, instead of ordinary, static habitat maps, these dynamic, time-lapse habitat maps could be used for grizzly bear conservation in a number of ways. First, they help calculate the carrying capacity of the study area. In other words, how many bears can the remaining habitat support? Is there enough food to go around? Second, the maps show where bears will be foraging at specific times. We can prevent disturbing the bears and stressing them out by avoiding these areas during important feeding periods. Finally, the maps can be used to predict the effects of climate change, where shifting annual temperatures will alter the rate of plant growth, throwing the bears' precise foraging schedule out of whack. This provides less food and increases competition between bears. Grizzlies are charismatic symbols of the wilderness. These habitat maps made from satellite imagery can not only help conserve grizzly bears but all sorts of different species. They aid us in understanding how ecosystems function, where they are threatened, and how we can try to keep our fragile, amazing planet intact.","Grizzly bears are fascinating creatures with diverse diets that include up to 90% vegetation.

82,82,DD_8Jm5pTLk,Reasons for the seasons - Rebecca Kaplan,"Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby When I was a kid, my understanding of the seasons was that December and January were cold and covered with snow, April and May were bursting with flowers, July and August were hot and sunshiny, and September and October were a kaleidoscope of colorful leaves. It was just the way the world worked, and it was magical. If you had told me back then that one-third of Earth's population had never seen snow or that July 4th was most definitely not a beach day, I would have thought you were crazy. But in reality, seasonal change with four distinct seasons only happens in two regions on the planet. And, even in those two, the seasons are reversed. But why? A lot of people have heard of an astronomer called Johannes Kepler and how he proved that planetary orbits are elliptical and that the sun is not at the center of the orbit. It was a big deal when he figured this out several hundred years ago. His discovery solved a lot of mathematical problems that astronomers were having with planetary orbit measurements. While it's true that our orbit's not perfectly circular, those pictures in our science books, on TV, and in the movies give an exaggerated impression of how elongated our orbit is. In fact, Earth's orbit is very nearly a perfect circle. However, because Earth's orbit is technically an ellipse, even though it doesn't look like one, and the sun isn't quite exactly at the center, it means that our distance from the sun does change through the year. Ah-ha! So, winter happens when the Earth is further away from the sun! Well, no, not so fast. The Earth is actually closer to the sun in January than we are in July by 5 million kilometers. January is smack-dab in the middle of the coldest season of the year for those of us up north. Still not convinced? How about this: Summer and winter occur simultaneously on the surface of our planet. When it's winter in Connecticut, it's summer in New Zealand. So, if it's not the distance from the sun, what else could it be? Well, we need to also need to know that the Earth doesn't sit straight up. It actually tilts. And that axial tilt of the Earth is one of the main reasons for the seasons. The Earth spins on an axis that's tilted 23.5 degrees from vertical. At the same time, the Earth revolves around the sun with the axis always pointing in the same direction in space. Together with the tilt, the spinning and revolving causes the number of hours of daylight in a region to change as the year goes by, with more hours in summer and fewer in winter. So, when the sun is shining on the Earth, it warms up. After the sun sets, it has time to cool down. So, in the summer, any location that's about 40 degrees north of the equator, like Hartford, Connecticut, will get 15 hours of daylight each day and 9 hours of darkness. It warms up for longer than it cools. This happens day after day, so there is an overall warming effect. Remember this fact for later! In the winter, the opposite happens. There are many more hours of cooling time than warming time, and day after day, this results in a cooling effect. The interesting thing is, as you move north, the number of daylight hours in summer increases. So, Juneau, Alaska would get about 19 hours of daylight on the same summer day that Tallahassee, Florida gets about 14. In fact, in the summertime at the North Pole, the sun never sets. OK, then, it's all about daylight hours, I've got it! Well, no, there's another important piece to this puzzle. If daylight hours were the only thing that determined average temperature, wouldn't the North Pole be the hottest place on Earth in northern summer because it receives 24 hours of daylight in the months surrounding the summer solstice? But it's the North Pole. There's still icebergs in the water and snow on the ground. So, what's going on? The Earth is a sphere and so the amount of solar energy an area receives changes based on how high the sun is in the sky, which, as you know, changes during the day between sunrise and sunset. But, the maximum height also changes during the year, with the greatest solar height during the summer months and highest of all at noon on the summer solstice, which is June 21st in the northern hemisphere and December 21st in the southern hemisphere. This is because as the Earth revolves, the northern hemisphere ends up tilted away from the sun in the winter and toward the sun in summer, which puts the sun more directly overhead for longer amounts of time. Remember those increased summer time daylight hours? And solar energy per square kilometer increases as the sun gets higher in the sky. So, when the sun's at an angle, the amount of energy delivered to each square of the sunlit area is less. Therefore, even though the North Pole is getting 24 hours of daylight to warm up, the sunlight it receives is very spread out and delivers less energy than a place further south, where the sun is higher in the sky because it's more tilted toward the sun. Besides, the North Pole has a lot to make up for. It was cooling down without any sunlight at all for 6 months straight. So, as the seasons change, wherever you are, you can now appreciate not just the beauty of each new season but the astronomical complexity that brings them to you.","The video explains why we have seasons and why they're not the same everywhere. The main reason for the seasons is Earth's axial tilt of 23.5 degrees, which causes the number of daylight hours to change as the year goes by. In summer, there are more hours of daylight, and the sun is higher in the sky, delivering more energy per square kilometer. In winter, there are fewer daylight hours, and the sun is lower in the sky, delivering less energy. The video also explains that Earth's orbit is not perfectly circular, but the change in distance from the sun is not the main reason for the seasons. The video concludes by encouraging viewers to appreciate the astronomical complexity that brings the seasons to us.

Curious facts from the video:

* Seasonal change with four distinct seasons only happens in two regions on the planet, and the seasons are reversed.
* One-third of Earth's population has never seen snow.
* July 4th is most definitely not a beach day in some parts of the world.
* Earth's orbit is technically an ellipse, but it's very nearly a perfect circle.
* Earth's axial tilt is one of the main reasons for the seasons.
* The Earth spins on an axis that's tilted 23.5 degrees from vertical.
* The Earth revolves around the sun with the axis always pointing in the same direction in space.
* The number of hours of daylight in a region changes as the year goes by, with more hours in summer and fewer in winter.
* The Earth is closer to the sun in January than we are in July by 5 million kilometers.
* Summer and winter occur simultaneously on the surface of our planet.
* The amount of solar energy an area receives changes based on how high the sun is in the sky.
* The maximum height of the sun also changes during the year, with the greatest solar height during the summer months.
* The North Pole is still cold in the summer because the sunlight it receives is very spread out and delivers less energy than a place further south.
* The North Pole has a lot to make up for because it was cooling down without any sunlight at all for 6 months straight."

Reviewer: Jessica Ruby There are all sorts of things that happen every day that might make you ask, ""Why? Why do we drive on a parkway and park on a driveway? Why does my hair get frizzy when it's humid? And why do my fingers get all pruney when they're wet?"" Often we simply can't know the answers to these questions. But progress can often be made, and, when it comes to your pruney fingers, scientists have a few interesting ideas. The story here begins with an observation made in the 1930s in the emergency room. Doctors noticed that patients with nerve damage to their hands did not get pruney fingertips like most of us do in a bath, which might make you wonder, ""Why would primates want wrinkly fingers, presumably when it's rainy or dewy?"" What could this trait be for? What if these wrinkles functioned like rain treads? Think about car tires. When the ground is dry, it's generally best to have smooth tires, and race cars do. Smooth tires means more rubber or surface area in contact with the road, which gives them better grip. But in rainy and muddy conditions, it's a different story, and here's where treads come into play. Treads reduce the amount of rubber on the road, but they help channel out water when it rains, lowering the risk of hydroplaning. Well, if your fingers really are like rain treads, you should be able to predict the optimal shape for them, right? So, what would the predicted wrinkle shapes be? That is, are our prunes actually the right shape to be rain treads? Let's take a detour into rivers. When we think of river networks, we usually imagine lots of smaller river channels joining to make larger river channels downstream, which is what happens in concave basins. In these cases, the divides, the regions between the river segments, are disconnected from one another and diverge away from one another uphill. But river networks look fundamentally different on convex promontories or protrusions. Here, the river channels are disconnected from one another and diverge away from one another downstream, not very river-like. In these cases, it's the divides that link together to form a tree, with its trunk uphill at the top of the promontory. Here, it's the divides that look more traditionally river-like. If our pruney fingers are drainage networks, designed to channel out water when they grip, then we expect to find similar shapes on our fingers as we find out there among rivers. There should be a tree network of divides, or ridges, with their trunk near the top of the fingertip and with their more leaky parts reaching out downhill, away from the tip. The channels themselves, through which the water is channeled during a grip, should not connect to one another, and instead should diverge away from one another downhill. If pruney fingers are rain treads, then they should look like the river networks on convex promontories. In fact, that's exactly the morphology we find among pruney fingers! When we grip, then, our pruney wrinkles really do channel out the water. But does it actually help us grip? New behavioral experiments have shown that they do. In a task where subjects had to grasp wet marbles and move them through a hole and out the other side, those with pruney fingers finished the task significantly faster than those with smooth fingers. Pruney fingers not only ought to enhance grip in wet conditions but do. So, pruney fingers may be a crucial part of the primate repertoire. Maybe, once primates lost their claws in favor of fingernails, rain treads were needed to deal with the especially challenging, often wet, grip-heavy forest habitats. By looking closely at the mysteries in our world and trying to find things that look similar, like our wet fingers and rain treads, we can come up with ideas about what's happening. And that's a good way to think about all sorts of questions in life, too.","Why do our fingers get pruney when wet? Scientists have a few theories. One is that pruney fingers act like rain treads, helping us grip in wet conditions. This idea comes from the observation that patients with nerve damage to their hands don't get pruney fingertips.

84,84,oKjFVBVGad0,The brilliance of bioluminescence - Leslie Kenna,"Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Imagine a place so dark you can't see the nose on your face. Eyes opened or closed, it's all the same because the sun never shines there. Up ahead, you see a light. When you creep in to investigate, a blue light flits around you. ""I could watch this forever,"" you think. But you can't because the mouth of an anglerfish has just sprung open and eaten you alive. You are just one of many creatures at the bottom of the ocean who learn too late to appreciate the power of bioluminescence. Bioluminescence refers to the ability of certain living things to create light. The human body can make stuff like ear wax and toe nails, but these organisms can turn parts of their body into glow sticks. It's like nature made them ready to rave. Why? In one way or another, bioluminescence improves a living thing's chances of survival. Take the firefly. It's ability to glow green helps it attract a mate on a warm, summer night, but it's just one of many living things that can glow. The railroad worm, Phrixothrix hirtus, can light up its body in two colors: red and green. Would you eat something that looks like an airport runway? Neither would any sensible predator. The flashing lights keep the worm safe. Then there's the deep sea shrimp, Acantherphyra purpurea. When it feels threatened, it spews a cloud of glowing goo from its mouth. Who doesn't run the other way when they've just been puked on? Plus, that puke attracts bigger predators who want to eat the shrimp's enemy. So what if you can't bioluminesce? No problem! There are other ways for living things to make bioluminescence work for them, even if they weren't born with the equipment to glow. Let's revisit the anglerfish moments before it tried to eat you. That glowing bait on top of its head? It comes from a pocket of skin called the esca. The esca holds bioluminescent bacteria. The anglerfish can't glow there by itself, so it holds a sack of glowing bacteria instead. Remember the firefly? It can actually make itself glow. Inside its lantern are two chemicals, a luciferin and a luciferase. When firefly luciferase and luciferin mix together in the presence of oxygen and fuel for the cell, called ATP, the chemical reaction gives off energy in the form of light. Once scientists figured out how the firefly creates its luciferase and luciferin, they used genetic engineering to make this light-producing reaction occur inside other living things that can't glow. For example, they inserted the genes, or instructions, for a cell to create firefly luciferase and luciferin into a tobacco plant. Once there, the tobacco plant followed the instructions slipped into its DNA and lit up like a Christmas tree. The beauty of bioluminescence, unlike the light from the sun or an incandescent bulb, is that it's not hot. It takes place in a range of temperatures that don't burn a living thing. And unlike a glow stick, which fades out as the chemicals inside get used up, bioluminescent reactions use replenishable resources. That's one reason engineers are trying to develop bioluminescent trees. Just think, if planted on the side of highways, they could light the way, using only oxygen and other freely available, clean resources to run. Talk about survival advantage! That could help our planet live longer. Do you find yourself thinking of other ways to put bioluminescence to good use? That glow stick you swing at a rave may help you find a mate, but how else can bioluminescence improve your survival? If you start thinking in this way, you have seen the light.","Bioluminescence is the ability of certain living organisms to create light. This phenomenon helps them survive in various ways, such as attracting mates or scaring off predators. For example, fireflies use bioluminescence to attract mates, while the railroad worm uses it to avoid being eaten. The deep-sea shrimp, Acantherphyra purpurea, spews a cloud of glowing goo to confuse and distract predators. Some organisms, like the anglerfish, use bioluminescent bacteria to create light. Scientists have even used genetic engineering to make non-bioluminescent organisms, like tobacco plants, produce light. Bioluminescence is a fascinating and useful phenomenon that could have many applications in the future, such as lighting up highways with bioluminescent trees.

85,85,hPLgfGX1I5Y,How did feathers evolve? - Carl Zimmer,"Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Feathers are some of the most remarkable things ever made by an animal. They are gorgeous in their complexity, delicate in their construction, and yet strong enough to hold a bird thousands of feet in the air. Like all things in nature, feathers evolved over millions of years into their modern form. It could be hard to imagine how this could have happened. After all, what did the intermediate forms look like? What good is half a wing, festooned with half-feathers? Thanks to science, we now know that birds are living dinosaurs. You can see the kinship in their skeletons. Certain dinosaurs share some anatomical details with birds found in no other animals, such as wish bones. And in the late 1990s, paleontologists started digging up some compelling support for that idea: dinosaurs with bits of feathers still preserved on their bodies. Since then, scientists have found dozens of species of dinosaurs with remnants of feathers. Some were as small as pigeons, and some were the size of a school bus. If you look at how they are related on a family tree, the evolution of feathers doesn't seem quite so impossible. The most distant feathered relatives of birds had straight feathers that looked like wires. Then these wires split apart, producing simple branches. In many dinosaur lineages, these simple feathers evolved into more intricate ones, including some that we see today on birds. At the same time, the feathers spread across the bodies of dinosaurs, turning from sparse patches of fuzz into dense plumage, which even extended down to their legs. A few fossils even preserved some of the molecules that give feathers color. They reveal a beautiful range of colors: glossy, dark plumage, reminiscent of crows, alternating strips of black and white, or splashes of bright red. Some dinosaurs had high crests on their heads, and others had long, dramatic tail feathers. Now, none of these dinosaurs could use their feathers to fly - their arms were too short and the rest of their bodies were far too heavy. But, birds don't just use feathers to fly. A woodcock uses feathers to blend in perfectly with its forest backdrop. An ostrich stretches its wings over its nest to shade its young. A peacock displays its magnificent tail feathers to attract peahens. Feathers could have served these functions for dinosaurs too. Exactly how feathered dinosaurs took flight is still a bit of a mystery. But if a small-feathered dinosaur flapped its arms as it ran up an incline, its feathers would have provided extra lift to help it run faster. This accident of physics might have led to the evolution of longer dinosaur arms, which would let them run faster and even leap short distances through the air. Eventually, their arms stretched out into wings. Only then, perhaps 50 million years after the first wiry feathers evolved, did feathers lift those dinosaurs into the sky.","Feathers are complex and beautiful, and they evolved over millions of years. Birds are living dinosaurs, and many dinosaurs had feathers. The first feathers were like wires, and they evolved into more intricate shapes. Feathers spread across dinosaur bodies and came in many colors. Dinosaurs couldn't fly with their feathers, but feathers had other uses, like hiding or attracting mates. Scientists think that small, feathered dinosaurs might have started flapping their arms as they ran, which led to longer arms and wings. Eventually, feathers let dinosaurs fly.

86,86,IYSlId-Ri7Q,Making sense of how life fits together - Bobbi Seleski,"Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar I like to think of life science as one big pyramid. Let's call the pyramid, ""biological organization"". Let's work our way from very small and specific concepts to very large and complex topics. So let's start at the tip of the pyramid, with something so small, it can't be seen by the human eye, a single cell. A cell by itself is the most basic component of life. A single cell, which is capable of living on its own, is called a unicellular organism, organisms like bacteria or protists. These organisms are everywhere you look, you just can't see them. But, when cells join together, with more than one cell like itself to perform a similar function, it's no longer a unicellular organism. It's then called a tissue. No, not that kind of tissue. There are four types of tissues found in the human body: connective, muscle, nervous, and epithelial. Bone tissue is a type of connective tissue and it's not flimsy like a Kleenex at all. Blood is also an example of the same cells working together to perform the same job, but it's a liquid, again, not like a Kleenex at all. No matter what the consistency is, a tissue is a group of the same cells, working together to perform a similar function. Any time there are different tissues working together, we then call it an organ. That's the next level of the pyramid. Animals aren't the only ones with organs; plants have organs too. When we find multiple different organs working together to perform the same job, we then call it an organ system. Take the digestive system, for example. It's made up of a mouth, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, liver, gall bladder, small intestine, and large intestine, also known as your colon. Although each individual organ in this organ system does a very different job, together, these organs work to achieve the one goal of taking all the nutrients out of the food we eat and getting rid of what we don't need. An organ system, by definition, can only do one job, like get the nutrients from our food, send and receive electrical signals, or exchange oxygen for carbon dioxide. Regardless of their individual function, all organ systems rely on one another to do the vital jobs which they can't do themselves. If one organ system doesn't work, the others will shut down, too. An organism is a complicated, living thing, which requires the proper functioning of multiple organ systems to maintain stability. This stability is called homeostasis. When all organ systems are working together and maintaining homeostasis, then it results in a happy, living organism. Organisms are incredibly diverse and can be as simple as a bacteria or as complex as you. When a group of the same organisms, also known as a species, live together in the same environment, we then call it a population. Often there are several populations all living in one environment. That is what we call a community. Each time you look out the window, you're seeing a community. When we look at multiple communities, along with how all of the organisms interact with the physical environment, then we refer to it as an ecosystem. When you look at all the ecosystems of Earth together, you're looking at the Earth. The Earth is a big, round circle of life. That's why we call it a biosphere - bio, meaning life and sphere, meaning circle. And there you go! When you break it down to each level, a very complex concept and phrase becomes easy to understand. All life starts with a single cell. When cells join together, they are called a tissue. A group of different tissues are called an organ, and a group of different organs are an organ system. A group of organ systems working together make up an organism, and a group of the same organisms are a population. Combining several different populations together give us a community. And several different communities in a large area is an ecosystem. And every ecosystem together makes up our biosphere. And that, my friends, is biological organization, the pyramid of life.","Life science can be seen as a pyramid, with the most basic component of life, a single cell, at the top.

87,87,Mehz7tCxjSE,How Mendel's pea plants helped us understand genetics - Hortensia Jiménez Díaz,"Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar These days scientists know how you inherit characteristics
from your parents. They're able to calculate probabilities
of having a specific trait or getting a genetic disease according to the information
from the parents and the family history. But how is this possible? To understand how traits pass
from one living being to its descendants, we need to go back in time
to the 19th century and a man named Gregor Mendel. Mendel was an Austrian monk and biologist who loved to work with plants. By breeding the pea plants
he was growing in the monastery's garden, he discovered the principles
that rule heredity. In one of most classic examples, Mendel combined
a purebred yellow-seeded plant with a purebred green-seeded plant, and he got only yellow seeds. He called the yellow-colored trait
the dominant one, because it was expressed
in all the new seeds. Then he let the new yellow-seeded
hybrid plants self-fertilize. And in this second generation,
he got both yellow and green seeds, which meant the green trait
had been hidden by the dominant yellow. He called this hidden trait
the recessive trait. From those results, Mendel inferred that each trait depends
on a pair of factors, one of them coming from the mother and the other from the father. Now we know that these factors
are called alleles and represent the different
variations of a gene. Depending on which type of allele
Mendel found in each seed, we can have what we call a homozygous pea,
where both alleles are identical, and what we call a heterozygous pea, when the two alleles are different. This combination of alleles
is known as genotype and its result, being yellow or green, is called phenotype. To clearly visualize how alleles
are distributed amongst descendants, we can a diagram
called the Punnett square. You place the different
alleles on both axes and then figure out
the possible combinations. Let's look at Mendel's peas, for example. Let's write the dominant yellow allele
as an uppercase ""Y"" and the recessive green allele
as a lowercase ""y."" The uppercase Y always
overpowers his lowercase friend, so the only time you get green babies is if you have lowercase Y's. In Mendel's first generation,
the yellow homozygous pea mom will give each pea kid
a yellow-dominant allele, and the green homozygous pea dad
will give a green-recessive allele. So all the pea kids
will be yellow heterozygous. Then, in the second generation, where the two heterozygous kids marry, their babies could have
any of the three possible genotypes, showing the two possible phenotypes in a three-to-one proportion. But even peas have
a lot of characteristics. For example, besides
being yellow or green, peas may be round or wrinkled. So we could have all
these possible combinations: round yellow peas, round green peas, wrinkled yellow peas, wrinkled green peas. To calculate the proportions
for each genotype and phenotype, we can use a Punnett square too. Of course, this will make it
a little more complex. And lots of things are more
complicated than peas, like, say, people. These days, scientists know a lot more
about genetics and heredity. And there are many other ways in which
some characteristics are inherited. But, it all started
with Mendel and his peas.","Gregor Mendel, an Austrian monk and biologist, discovered the principles of heredity by breeding pea plants in the monastery's garden in the 19th century.

88,88,eo5XndJaz-Y,The simple story of photosynthesis and food - Amanda Ooten,"Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Ever wonder where most of the food you eat every day comes from? Well, about 60% of the food you eat is carbohydrates. As you can probably tell from its name, carbohydrates contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. But where do these atoms originally come from and how do they join together to make delicious foods like fruits and pasta? It actually all starts with the air you are exhaling this very minute, specifically the carbon dioxide molecules. Plants are going to breath in this very same carbon dioxide through pores in their skin, called stomata. Plants drink in water from their roots to get the needed oxygen and hydrogen atoms, and their electrons, in order to build carbohydrates. What is that thing? Well, that's a special plant organelle inside the leaves of plants called a chloroplast. It's green beceause of a special light-absorbing pigment called chlorophyll. Each leaf has about 44,000 cells and every cell can have anywhere between 20 to 100 chloroplasts. That's up to 4,400,000 chloroplasts! By now, you've probably guessed that we're talking about the process of photosynthesis and you might be wondering when the sun is going to make its entrance. Let's go back to that original molecule of water. The plant has to split this molecule of water so it can get electrons from it. But, the plant can't pull that water apart by itself. It needs help from the high-energy rays of the sun. So now that the chloroplast has all the building blocks - carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and electrons - it can use them to go through the rest of the steps of photosynthesis to transform that original carbon dioxide gas into a simple carbohydrate called glucose, C-6-H-12-O-6. That little glucose molecule then helps to build bigger and better carbohydrates like cellulose. Cellulose is a type of carbohydrate found in plants that our body cannot break down. We call it fiber and we eat it in vegetables like lettuce, broccoli, and celery. Plants use cellulose to keep themselves strong. The plant could also turn that glucose into starch, a large molecule that stores energy for the plant. We love eating starch from plants like potatoes, corn, and rice. So you see, when you eat plants, we're actually benefiting from photosynthesis. The plant makes things like starch, which we eat and then break back down into glucose, the first form the plant made. Then, the mitochondria in our cells, powered by the oxygen we breath, can turn glucose into pure energy molecules called ATP. ATP powers all work done by each and every one of your cells, things like communication, movement, and transport. But why do we have to turn that glucose into ATP? Well, think of it like this. You're excited to start your summer job at the local ice cream stand, but your boss has just told you that she is going to pay you in ice cream cones. What are you going to be able to do with those ice cream cones? Nothing, which is why you kindly asked to be paid in dollars. ATP is just like dollars. It is the currency that all cells of life use while glucose is, well, kind of like ice cream. Even plants have mitochondria in their cells to break down the glucose they make into ATP. So as you can see, humans and plants are intricately connected. The air we breath out is used by plants to make the carbohydrates we enjoy so much. And, in the process, they are releasing the very same oxygen molecules we need to breath in in order that our mitochondria can break down our delicous carbohydrate meal.","The video explains how photosynthesis works and how it's related to the food we eat. Plants use carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to create glucose through photosynthesis. Glucose is then used to create other carbohydrates, such as cellulose and starch. Humans and animals eat these carbohydrates and break them down into glucose again, which is then converted into ATP for energy. The video highlights the interconnectedness of humans, plants, and the environment.

* 60% of the food humans eat is carbohydrates.
* Plants use carbon dioxide from the air and water from their roots to create glucose.

89,89,Pz6AQXQGupQ,Where we get our fresh water - Christiana Z. Peppard,"Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar At birth, our bodies are roughly 75% water. We remain mostly water for the rest of our lives. We cannot survive even a week without fresh water. There's no life without it for ecosystems, societies, and individuals. So, how much usable water is there on Earth? Most of the water on Earth is ocean, a salty 97.5%, to be precise, and the remaining 2.5% is fresh water. That little sliver of liquid sustains human life on Earth, it literally holds up civilizations. 2.5% is a small proportion to be sure, and even that is broken down into smaller parts: surface water, water in ice caps and polar regions, and ground water. First, surface water. All the liquid water above ground is surface water and it is a tiny blip of an amount. 0.3% of all fresh water is surface water. It may seem counterintuitive, but it accounts for little streams all over the planet. All rivers, including the Nile, the Jordan, and the Mississippi, and lakes, large to small, like Victoria, the Great Lakes, and Baikal. Second, ice caps and polar regions freeze up to 70% of the planet's fresh water. This water is significant, but it isn't available for human use in a regular way. Finally, nearly 30% of all water on Earth is ground water. As the name suggests, that's water in the ground. It can rest still and deep in huge caverns, or it can snuggle in the little crevices of rock and pebble. The upshot - thank goodness for ground water! It's invisible to us, but it is much more plentiful than surface water. It is much more reliable and easier to obtain than frozen water. Without ground water, our societies would be parched. So, how are we using that water? As a result of industrialization and population growth, demand for fresh water skyrocketed in the last century. Where is all that water going? First, we have to remember that fresh water is a global concern, but it is always local. Context matters. The Sahara is not Seattle. Still, some general information can help us get a handle on major trends. Who consumes the most fresh water? And, what sectors consume the most fresh water? First, who. Well, the United States consumes the most water per capita of any country in the entire world, followed by parts of Europe and large industrializing nations like China. But, this doesn't tell us what water is being used for. So let's look at it another way. If we ask what kinds of uses water is going towards, we see a different picture. Agriculture accounts for roughly 70% of global fresh water consumption. Again, remember the numbers vary by region, but still, it's a staggering amount. And, this makes a certain kind of sense: we need to eat, we need water to grow food; the bigger the population, the more food we need; and, the wealthier we get, the more meat we eat, and the more water is required to produce our food. Furthermore, 22% of all fresh water worldwide goes to industrial uses. This includes the production of electricity, the extraction of fossil fuels, and the manufacturing of all manner of goods, from microchips, to paper, to blimps. 70% to agriculture, 22% to industrial uses, what's left? 8% All those domestic uses - cooking, cleaning, bathing, drinking - it's a drop in the bucket of overall water use.","Did you know that our bodies are 75% water at birth and that we can't survive a week without fresh water?

* Fresh water is only 2.5% of all the water on Earth.
* Seventy percent of global fresh water consumption goes to agriculture.
* The United States consumes the most water per capita of any country in the world.
* Fresh water is always local, and context matters.
* Without ground water, our societies would be parched.
* Industrialization and population growth have caused demand for fresh water to skyrocket in the last century.
* Twenty-two percent of all fresh water worldwide goes to industrial uses.
* Eight percent of all fresh water worldwide goes to domestic uses like cooking, cleaning, bathing, and drinking.
* Ice caps and polar regions freeze up to 70% of the planet's fresh water, but it isn't available for human use in a regular way.
* Surface water is only 0.3% of all fresh water, and it includes all rivers and lakes.
* Fresh water is a global concern, but it is always local."
90,90,TlyvS1ckDZM,"Curiosity, discovery and gecko feet - Robert Full","Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Nearly every one of your science classes starts off with the scientific method. You recognize this? Ask a question, form a hypothesis, perform an experiment, collect data, draw conclusions, and then memorize a bunch of facts. This is really boring! Science is not a simple recipe in a cookbook, and learning is not memorizing facts for tests. Yet, that is exactly what we do. We have to change this! We have to look at how curiosity can ultimately benefit society by looking towards tomorrow, by going through a path from involvement to imagination to invention to innovation. And I'd like to illustrate this by telling you the real story about how we discovered how geckos stick. First you need to get involved. You need to do curiosity-driven research yourself. We know that learning by being an active researcher is the best way to learn. Imagine being in my lab and trying to discover how geckos stick. ""Here is one of our subjects. This is a crested gecko. We are going to put the gecko on glass and we're going to use a high speed camera that can capture up to 1,000 pictures in one second. There he goes. OK, record it. There's the animal's toes."" ""So how do their feet stick and unstick so quickly?"" How do they do this? We wonder, it's kind of crazy, right? It's hard to believe. Well it turns out, it was already known that the geckos have hairy toes, and those hairs are really small compared to your hair, and the little tips at the end are even smaller. Well, my student Tanya, who is not much older than some of you when she did this, a sophomore undergraduate, tried to figure this out, and we told that her that in order to do this, you'd have to measure the force of a single hair. Though we kind of only did this jokingly because these hairs are so small, we didn't think it was possible. But Tanya didn't know that, and she went on to build the simplest, most beautiful measurement device ever. Here it is: she took one of those tiny little hairs and put it on to a probe, and then she began pushing it into the metal beam. Now she was very frustrated for months - it didn't stick. But she had figured out she had to orient it just like the gecko grabs on, and then it worked! And there's the little split ends grabbing the beam in that little window. And then she did something magical: for the first time ever, she measured the force of a single gecko hair that allowed her to discover a completely new way to stick to something, something no human has ever known before. They have hairy little toes, huge numbers of hairs, and each hair has the worst case of split ends possible, 100 to 1,000 nano-tips that an animal has on one hair, and 2 billion total, and they don't stick by glue, or by suction, or by velcro. It was discovered that they stick by inter-molecular forces alone, by van der Waals forces, and you'll learn this in Chemistry and Physics, if you take it. It's unbelievable! It's a whole new way of thinking about making an adhesive! Well, this isn't the end of the story, there are still mysteries. Why are the gecko's feet looking like this? They have bizarre toes and we don't know why. If you go into a museum and look at each gecko species, you see they have all different hairs, different lengths, and thicknesses, and patterns. Why? I don't know! But you should come to Berkeley and help me figure this out. It's just about right, so, apply. But it's a mystery. There is even more stuff that is unknown. This tarantula also has hairs and can stick this way, too, but recently it was found that they also can secrete silk from their feet, not just their behind, like you know they do. And even more recently, my graduate student Ann showed that all spiders can secrete glue, and we know nothing about this glue except it was around way before this guy, millions of years before. So don't stop at the discovery, next imagine the possible uses for society. Here is the first human supported by a gecko-inspired adhesive. This is my former graduate student, Kellar Autumn, who is professor at Lewis and Clark, offering his second born child for the test. And she's a very good sport about it! Now imagine all the things you could make from this, not only adhesives, but products in sports, and biomedicine, technology, robotics, toys, automotive, fashion, clothes, and yes, even hair pieces. I swear to you, we got a call from Michael Jackson's hairdresser about hair pieces before he passed away. Who would have guessed from studying geckos?!? Next, invent a game-changing technology, device, or product. Like my engineering colleague at Berkeley, Ron Fearing, did when he made one of the first synthetic, self-cleaning dry adhesives after the simplest version that you see in animals. Believe it or not, right now, because of this work, you can make your own synthetic gecko nano-tape by nano-molding with just a few parts, and here's the recipe that we can give you. It's been incredible since we made this discovery of all the papers and the work and the different ways to make it, it's emerging into a billion dollar industry. And who would have imagined that it started because we were curious about how geckos can run up walls. Next you need to innovate, create a business that ultimately benefits society. Did you know that there are 6 million people per year that have chronic wounds, 2 million develop an infection, and infections account for 100,000 hospital deaths? Imagine if you could build a company that could produce a gecko-inspired band-aid that would remove the pain and suffering. Just a simple invention. If you look at the last three great earthquakes, over 700,000 people were trapped and lost their lives. Imagine the company that made a search-and-rescue robot inspired from a gecko that could move anywhere and quickly find individuals that have been trapped, that sometimes survive as long as two weeks. There is a gecko-inspired robot, StickyBot, from the Stanford group, that can grab on to any surface. Now we ran our own, for TED, Mini Bio-inspired Design Challenge to get you to think about these kinds of products. We have a winner. Here's the winner. The winner came up with this design called StickySeat. Really clever. It's a seat that is not only comfortable, but it aids a seat belt, if you were in an accident, in terms of keeping your seat and moving. This is brilliant! We didn't think about this, although we might think about patenting it now, but there is a winner for this, and the winner, and you can't, you can't make up something like this, the winner's name is Harry. Where's Harry? Harry, come here, we have a prize for you. Where's Harry? Harry! Come here! We have a crested gecko for you that has very cool hairs on it. Congratulations for Harry! Excellent job! So don't worry, if you missed out on this, it's OK because we are doing another design challenge working with the San Diego Zoo. They're developing a best ideas project in San Diego, but it's going to go national. And I'll leave you with a fact that you should keep being curious because curiosity-based research leads to the biggest benefits, as we showed you in our example, and you can make a difference now because like Tanya, you don't know what can't be done. Thank you.","Robert Full, a professor at Berkeley, talks about the importance of curiosity in scientific research. He shares the story of how his student Tanya discovered how geckos stick to surfaces. By being actively involved in research, Tanya was able to measure the force of a single gecko hair, leading to the discovery of a new way to stick to something. Full emphasizes that science is not about memorizing facts but about curiosity, imagination, invention, and innovation. He encourages students to apply their curiosity to real-world problems and imagine the possible uses of their discoveries, such as creating adhesives, products, and even hairpieces. Full concludes by emphasizing the importance of innovation and creating businesses that benefit society.

91,91,enfO5s0_uvM,How life came to land - Tierney Thys,"Transcriber: tom carter
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar (Stories from the Sea: How Life Came to Land) Life for my kind wasn't always this way. There was a time when no animals lived on land. All life was in the ocean. The ocean's where all of us animals got our start, more than half a billion years ago, This is where all animal body types -- or phyla, as scientists call them -- first evolved. You know, there are more than 30 animal phyla, but only a handful of major ones had what it took to do something completely daring: step out of the ocean, and on to dry land. So, which of these land-dwelling phyla first invaded the land? Was it me and my mollusc friends, with our amazing mantles and single foot? Perhaps the chordate crowd, with their notochords, segmented muscles and big bony skeletons. Or maybe those lowly annelid worms, with their powerful ringed bodies. Or did the Arthropods first make landfall, with their little flexible suits of armor -- their exoskeleton? Ah, yes. The arthropods. From crustaceans to millipedes, spiders to insects, the arthropods outnumber all animals on land. So what's their secret? Their exoskeleton is key, but here's the real kicker: jointed appendages. They're like little living Swiss army knives: antennae, multiple mouth parts, an obscene number of legs, if you ask me. There's one group of arthropods -- the insects -- that really rule the land. Three body parts, six legs, and an annoying tendency to take over. Sure, they have to molt to grow, but that doesn't seem to pose a problem. The insects even invented the first wings, and conquered the skies. Ah, well. So what if arthropods were the first to reach land and invent flight, a hundred million years before the rest of us? So what if they pollinate crops around the world, and make up 75% of all land animal species? And that for every single human, there's 200 million of them? Sure, those leggy arthropods may still be in the lead when it comes to conquering land, but we still rule in the sea. There are more species of molluscs in the ocean than any other animal phylum. We're just getting started up here on land. Besides, the seas are rising. Just give us some time. Who knows who'll end up ruling this ocean planet?","The video, narrated by a mollusc, explores the question of which animal phylum first came to land. The four main candidates are molluscs, chordates, annelids, and arthropods. The arthropods, with their exoskeleton and jointed appendages, are the most successful land-dwellers, with insects being the most numerous. However, molluscs still rule the seas and are the most diverse phylum in the ocean. The video ends on a hopeful note, suggesting that molluscs may eventually conquer land as the seas rise.

Curious facts from the video:

* All life began in the ocean, and only a few animal phyla have successfully invaded land.
* Arthropods, with their exoskeleton and jointed appendages, are the most successful land-dwellers.
* Insects, a group of arthropods, are the most numerous land animals and invented the first wings.
* Molluscs are the most diverse animal phylum in the ocean, with more species than any other phylum.
* The video suggests that molluscs may eventually conquer land as the seas rise."
92,92,5NdMnlt2keE,Five fingers of evolution - Paul Andersen,"The Five Fingers of Evolution. A thorough understanding of biology requires a thorough understanding
of the process of evolution. Most people are familiar
with the process of natural selection. However, this is just one
of five processes that can result in evolution. Before we discuss
all five of these processes, we should define evolution. Evolution is simply change
in the gene pool over time. But what is a gene pool? And for that matter, what is a gene? Before spending any more time on genetics, let us begin with a story. Imagine that a boat capsizes, and 10 survivors
swim to shore on a deserted island. They are never rescued, and they form a new population
that exists for thousands of years. Strangely enough,
five of the survivors have red hair. Red hair is created
when a person inherits two copies of the red gene from their parents. If you only have one copy of the gene,
you won't have red hair. To make this easier, we will assume that the five non-redheads
are not carriers of the gene. The initial frequency of the red-hair gene
is therefore 50 percent, or 10 of 20 total genes. These genes are the gene pool. The 20 different genes
are like cards in a deck that keep getting reshuffled
with each new generation. Sex is simply a reshuffling
of the genetic deck. The cards are reshuffled
and passed to the next generation; the deck remains the same, 50 percent red. The genes are reshuffled
and passed to the next generation; the gene pool remains
the same, 50 percent red. Even though the population
may grow in size over time, the frequency should stay
at about 50 percent. If this frequency ever varies,
then evolution has occurred. Evolution is simply change
in the gene pool over time. Think about it in terms of the cards. If the frequency of the cards
in the deck ever changes, evolution has occurred. There are five processes
that can cause the frequency to change. To remember these processes,
we will use the fingers on your hands, starting from the little finger
and moving to the thumb. The little finger should remind you
that the population can shrink. If the population shrinks,
then chance can take over. For example, if only four
individuals survive an epidemic, then their genes will represent
the new gene pool. The next finger is the ring finger. This finger should remind you of mating,
because a ring represents a couple. If individuals choose a mate
based on their appearance or location, the frequency may change. If redheaded individuals only mate
with redheaded individuals, they could eventually
form a new population. If no one ever mates
with redheaded individuals, these genes could decrease. The next finger is the middle finger. The M in the middle finger should remind
you of the M in the word ""mutation."" If a new gene is added through mutation,
it can affect the frequency. Imagine a gene mutation
creates a new color of hair. This would obviously change
the frequency in the gene pool. The pointer finger
should remind you of movement. If new individuals
flow into an area, or immigrate, the frequency will change. If individuals flow out
of an area, or emigrate, then the frequency will change. In science, we refer to this
movement as gene flow. All four of the processes represented
by our fingers can cause evolution. Small population size, non-random mating, mutations and gene flow. However, none of them lead to adaptation. Natural selection is the only process that creates organisms
better adapted to their local environment. I use the thumb to remember this process. Nature votes thumbs up for adaptations
that will do well in their environment, and thumbs down to adaptations
that will do poorly. The genes for individuals
that are not adapted for their environment will gradually be replaced
by those that are better adapted. Red hair is an example
of one of these adaptations. Red hair is an advantage
in the northern climates, because the fair skin
allowed ancestors to absorb more light and synthesize more vitamin D. Thumbs up! However, this was a disadvantage
in the more southern climates, where increased UV radiation
led to cancer and decreased fertility. Thumbs down! Even the thumb itself is an adaptation formed through the process
of natural selection. The evolution that we have described
is referred to as microevolution, because it refers to a small change. However, this form of evolution may eventually lead
to macroevolution, or speciation. Every organism on the planet shares
ancestry with a single common ancestor. All living organisms on the planet
are connected back in time through the process of evolution. Take a look at your own hand. It's an engineering masterpiece that was created by the five
processes I just described, over millions and millions of years. Can you recall the five main
causes of evolution from memory? If you can't, hit rewind
and watch that part again. But if you can, give yourself or your neighbor
a big five-fingered high five.","The video explains the five fingers of evolution, which are the five processes that can result in evolution. Evolution is defined as change in the gene pool over time. The gene pool is the sum of all the genes in a population. The five processes are: 1) genetic drift, which can occur when the population size is small and chance can take over; 2) non-random mating, which can happen when individuals choose a mate based on their appearance or location; 3) mutation, which can add a new gene to the gene pool; 4) gene flow, which can happen when new individuals flow into an area or immigrate, or when individuals flow out of an area or emigrate; and 5) natural selection, which is the only process that creates organisms better adapted to their local environment. The video also explains that evolution can lead to macroevolution, or speciation, and that all living organisms on the planet share ancestry with a single common ancestor.

93,93,tr4gWi9Jf6k,The Cockroach Beatbox,"When you think about the brain, it's difficult to understand, because if I were to ask you right now,
how does the heart work, you would instantly tell me it's a pump. It pumps blood. If I were to ask about your lungs, you would say it exchanges
oxygen for carbon dioxide. That's easy. If I were to ask you how the brain works,
it's hard to understand because you can't just look
at a brain and understand what it is. It's not a mechanical object,
not a pump, not an airbag. It's just like, if you held it
in your hand when it was dead, it's just a piece of fat. To understand how the brain works,
you have to go inside a living brain. Because the brain's not mechanical,
the brain is electrical and it's chemical. Your brain is made out of
100 billion cells, called neurons. And these neurons communicate
with each other with electricity. And we're going to eavesdrop
in on a conversation between two cells, and we're going to listen
to something called a spike. But we're not going to record my brain
or your brain or your teachers' brains, we're going to use our good
friend the cockroach. Not just because I think they're cool, but because they have brains
very similar to ours. So if you learn a little bit
about how their brains work, we're going to learn a lot
about how our brains work. I'm going to put them
in some ice water here And then -- Audience: Ew!
Greg Gabe: Yeah ... Right now they're becoming anesthetized. Because they're cold blooded,
they become the temperature of the water and they can't control it
so they just basically ""chillax,"" right? They're not going to feel anything, which may tell you a little
about what we're going to do, a scientific experiment
to understand the brain. So ... This is the leg of a cockroach. And a cockroach
has all these beautiful hairs and pricklies all over it. Underneath each one of those is a cell, and this cell's a neuron
that is going to send information about wind or vibration. If you ever try to catch a cockroach,
it's hard because they can feel you coming before you're even there,
they start running. These cells are zipping up
this information up to the brain using those little axons
with electronic messages in there. We're going to record
by sticking a pin right in there. We need to take off the leg
of a cockroach -- don't worry, they'll grow back -- then we're going to put two pins in there. These are metal pins. One will pick up this electronic message,
this electric message is going by. So, we're now going to do the surgery,
let's see if you guys can see this. Yeah, it's gross ... All right. So there we go. You guys can see his leg right there. Now I'm going to take this leg, I'm going to put it in this invention
that we came up with called the Spikerbox -- and this replaces lots of expensive
equipment in a research lab, so you guys can do this
in your own high schools, or in your own basements if it's me. (Audience: Laughter) So, there. Can you guys see that? Alright, so I'm going to go ahead
and turn this on. I'm going to plug it in. (Tuning sound) To me, this is the most beautiful
sound in the world. This is what your brain
is doing right now. You have 100 billion cells
making these raindrop-type noises. Let's take a look at what it looks like, let's pull it up on the iPad screen. I plugged my iPad into here as well. So remember we said
the axon looks like a spike. So we're going to take a look at what one of them
looks like in just a brief second. We're going to tap here, so we can sort of average this guy. So there we see it.
That's an action potential. You've got 100 billion cells
in your brain doing this right now, sending all this information back
about what you're seeing, hearing. We also said this is a cell that's going to be taking up information
about vibrations in the wind. So what if we do an experiment? We can actually blow on this
and hear if we see a change. Are you guys going to be ready? If I blow on it you tell me
if you hear anything. (Blowing) (Sound changes) Let me just touch this
with a little pen here. (Noise) That was the neural firing rate. That actually took a while
in neuroscience to understand this. This is called rate coding: the harder you press on something,
the more spikes there are, and all that information
is coming up to your brain. That's how you perceive things. So that's one way of doing
an experiment with electricity. The other way is that your brain is not
only taking in electrical impulses, you're also sending out. That's how you move your muscles around. Let's see what happens if I've plugged in
something that's electric into the cockroach leg here. I'm going to take two pins,
I'm going to plug them onto the cockroach. I'm going to take the other end,
I'm going to plug in into my iPod. It's my iPhone actually. Do you guys know how your earbuds
work in your ears? You have a battery
in your phone, or iPod, right? It's sending electrical current
into these magnets in your earbuds which shake back and forth
and allow you to hear things. But that current's the same currency
that our brain uses, so we can send that to our cockroach leg and hopefully if this works, we can actually see what happens
when we play music into the cockroach. Let's take a look. (Music beat) Can we turn it up? There we go. (Audience reacts and gasps) GG: So what's happening? Audience: Wow! (Laughter) So you see what's moving.
It's moving on the bass. All those audiophiles out there, if you have awesome, kicking car stereos, you know, the bass speakers
are the biggest speakers. The biggest speakers
have the longest waves, which have the most current, and the current is what's causing
these things to move. So it's not just speakers
that are causing electricity. Microphones also cause electricity. (Beat) So I'm going to go ahead and invite
another person out on the stage here to help me out with this. So there we go. (Beatboxing) This is the first time this has ever
happened in the history of mankind. Human beatbox to a cockroach leg. When you guys go back to your high school,
think about neuroscience and how you guys can begin
the neuro-revolution. Thank you very much. Bye bye. (Applause)","The video is about the brain and how it works.

94,94,ckGB5lHyzME,Evolution in a Big City,"So I'm here today to encourage
you to think about New York City, and not just as one
of humanity's greatest achievements, but as home to native wildlife that are subject to a grand
evolutionary experiment. So take this forested hillside
in Northern Manhattan, for example. This is one of the last areas
left in the city where there's clean spring water
seeping out of the ground. You could drink this
out of your hands and you'd be OK. These tiny little areas of seeping water contain huge populations
of northern dusky salamanders. These guys were common in the city
maybe 60 years ago, but now they're just stuck
on this single hillside and a few places in Staten Island. Not only do they suffer the indignity
of being stuck on this hillside, but we divided the hillside in two on two different occasions with bridges crossing
from the Bronx into Manhattan. But they're still there,
on either side of the bridges, where you see the red arrows --
about 180th Street, 167th Street. My lab has found that if you just take
a few segments of DNA from salamanders in those two locations, you can tell which side
of the bridge they came from. We built this single piece
of infrastructure that's changed their evolutionary history. We can go study these guys,
we just go to the hillside we know where they are,
we flip over rocks so we can catch them. There are a lot of other things
in New York City, though, that are not that easy to capture,
such as this guy, a coyote. We caught him on an automatic camera trap
in an undisclosed location; I'm not allowed to talk about it yet. But they're moving into New York City
for the first time. They're very flexible,
intelligent animals. This is one of this year's pups
checking out one of our cameras. And my colleagues and I
are very interested in understanding how they're going to spread
through the area, how they're going to survive here
and maybe even thrive. And they're probably coming
to a neighborhood near you, if they're not already there. Some things are too fast
to be caught by hand. We can't pick them up on the cameras, so we set up traps
around New York City and the parks. This is one of our most common activities. Here's some of my students
and collaborators getting the traps out and ready. This guy, we catch in almost
every forested area in New York City. This is the white-footed mouse -- not the mouse you find
running around your apartment. This is a native species,
been here long before humans. You find them in forests and meadows. Because they're so common
in forested areas in the city, we're using them as a model
to understand how species are adapting to urban environments. So if you think back 400 years ago, the five boroughs would've been covered
in forests and other types of vegetation. This mouse would've been everywhere
[in] huge populations that showed few genetic differences
across the landscape. But if you look at the situation today, they're just stuck in these little islands
of forest scattered around the city. Just using 18 short segments of DNA,
we can pretty much take a mouse somebody could give us a mouse,
not tell us where it was from, and we could determine
what park it came from. That's how different they've become. You'll notice in the middle
of this figure, there are some mixed-up colors. There are a few parks in the city
that are still connected to each other with strips of forest,
so the mice can run back and forth and spread their genes,
so they don't become different. But throughout the city, they're mostly
becoming different in the parks. So I'm telling you they're different,
but what does that mean? What's changing about their biology? To answer this question, we're sequencing thousands
of genes from our city mice and comparing those to thousands
of genes from the country mice, so, their ancestors
outside of New York City in these big, more wilderness areas. Now, genes are short segments of DNA
that code for amino acids. And amino acids are
the building blocks of proteins. If a single base pair changes in a gene, you can get a different amino acid, which will then change the shape
and structure of the protein. If you change the structure of a protein, you often change something
about what it does in the organism. Now if that change leads to a longer
life or more babies for a mouse, something evolutionary
biologists call fitness, then that single base-pair change
will spread quickly in an urban population. So this crazy figure
is called a Manhattan plot, because it kind of looks like a skyline. Each dot represents one gene, and the higher the dot is in the plot, the more different it is
between city and country mice. The ones kind of at the tips
of the skyscrapers are the most different, especially those above the red line. And these genes encode for things
like immune response to disease, because there might be more disease
in very dense, urban populations; metabolism, how the mice use energy; and heavy-metal tolerance. You guys can probably predict that New York City soils
are pretty contaminated with lead and chromium
and that sort of thing. And now our hard work is really starting. We're going back into the wilds
of New York City parks, following the lives of individual mice and seeing exactly
what these genes are doing for them. And I would encourage you guys
to try to look at your parks in a new way. I'm not going to be
the next Charles Darwin, but one of you guys might be,

95,95,2AM3ARs9MMg,Symbiosis: A surprising tale of species cooperation - David Gonzales,"Are you familiar with the word symbiosis? It's a fancy term for a partnership
between two different species, such as bees and flowers. In a symbiosis, both species
depend on each other. I want to tell you
about a remarkable symbiosis between a little bird,
the Clark's nutcracker, and a big tree, the whitebark pine. Whitebark grow in the mountains
of Wyoming, Montana and other western states. They have huge canopies
and lots of needles, which provide cover and shelter
for other plants and animals, and whitebark feed the forest. Their cones are packed with protein. Squirrels gnaw the cones
from the upper branches so they fall to the ground, and then race down to bury them
in piles, or middens. But they don't get to keep all of them; grizzlies and black bears
love finding middens. But there's more to a symbiosis
than one species feeding another. In the case of the Clark's nutcracker,
this bird gives back. While gathering its seeds,
it also replants the trees. Here's how it works:
using her powerful beak, the nutcracker picks apart
a cone in a treetop, pulling out the seeds. She can store up to 80 of them
in a pouch in her throat. Then she flies through the forest looking for a place to cache the seeds an inch under the soil
in piles of up to eight seeds. Nutcrackers can gather
up to 90,000 seeds in the autumn, which they return for
in the winter and spring. And these birds are smart. They remember where all those seeds are. They even use landmarks
on the landscape -- trees, stumps, rocks -- to triangulate to caches
buried deep under the snow. What they don't go back and get,
those seeds become whitebark. This symbiosis is
so important to both species that they've changed,
or evolved, to suit each other. Nutcrackers have developed
long, tough beaks for extracting seeds from cones, and whitebarks' branches all sweep upwards with the cones at the very ends, so they can offer them
to the nutcrackers as they fly by. That's a symbiosis: Two species cooperating to help
each other for the benefit of all.","Symbiosis is a partnership between two different species. A fascinating example is the relationship between the Clark's nutcracker bird and the whitebark pine tree. The whitebark pine has protein-rich cones that attract squirrels, grizzlies, and black bears. However, the nutcracker bird plays a unique role. It collects the seeds, stores them in its throat pouch, and then buries them in the soil. The bird remembers the location of these seeds and returns to them in winter and spring. The seeds that the nutcracker doesn't retrieve become new whitebark pine trees. This symbiosis is so crucial that both species have evolved to suit each other. The nutcracker has a long, tough beak, and the whitebark pine has branches that sweep upwards, making it easier for the nutcracker to extract the seeds."
96,96,kMWxuF9YW38,Sex Determination: More Complicated Than You Thought,"Translator: Bedirhan Cinar My wife is pregnant right
now with our first child, and when people see her
with her big baby bump, the first question people ask,
almost without fail, is, ""Is it a boy or is it a girl?"" Now, there are some assumptions
behind that question that we take for granted because of our familiarity
with our own human biology. For human babies, we take it for granted
that there's a 50/50 chance of either answer, boy or girl. But why is it that way? Well, the answer depends
on the sex determination system that has evolved for our species. You see, for most mammals, the sex of a baby
is determined genetically with the XY chromosome system. Mammals have a pair of sex chromosomes, one passed down from mom,
and one from dad. A pair of X's gives us a girl, and an X and a Y together gives us a boy. Since females only have X's to pass
on in their egg cells, and males can give either an X
or a Y in their sperm cells, the sex is determined by the father and the chance of producing
a male or a female is 50/50. This system has worked well for mammals, but throughout the tree of life,
we can see other systems that have worked just
as well for other animals. There are other groups of animals
that also have genetic sex determination, but their systems can be
pretty different from ours. Birds and some reptiles have
their sex genetically determined, but instead of the sex
being determined by dad, their sex is determined by mom. In those groups,
a pair of Z sex chromosomes produces a male, so these males
only have Z's to give. However, in these animals,
one Z and one W chromosome together, as a pair, produces a female. In this system, the chance of a male
or a female is still 50/50, it just depends on whether
mom puts a Z or a W into her egg. Certain groups have taken
genetic sex determination in completely other directions. Ants, for example, have
one of the most interesting systems for determining sex, and because of it,
if you are a male ant, you do not have a father. In an ant colony, there
are dramatic divisions of labor. There are soldiers that defend the colony, there are workers that collect food,
clean the nest and care for the young, and there's a queen and a small group
of male reproductives. Now, the queen will mate and then
store sperm from the males. And this is where the system
gets really interesting. If the queen uses the stored
sperm to fertilize an egg, then that egg will grow up
to become female. However, if she lays an egg
without fertilizing it, then that egg will still
grow up to be an ant, but it will always be a male. So you see, it's impossible
for male ants to have fathers. And male ants live their life like this,
with only one copy of every gene, much like a walking sex cell. This system is called
a haplodiploid system, and we see it not only in ants, but also in other highly social
insects like bees and wasps. Since our own sex is determined by genes, and we do know of these other animals
that have their sex determined by genes, it's easy to assume that for all animals the sex of their babies still
must be determined by genetics. However, for some animals, the question
of whether it will be a boy or a girl has nothing to do with genes at all, and it can depend on something
like the weather. These are animals like alligators
and most turtles. In these animals, the sex
of an embryo in a developing egg is determined by the temperature. In these species, the sex of the baby is not yet determined
when the egg is laid, and it remains undetermined
until sometime in the middle of the overall development period,
when a critical time is reached. And during this time, the sex
is completely determined by temperature in the nest. In painted turtles, for example, warm temperatures
above the critical temperature will produce females within the eggs, and cool temperatures will produce a male. I'm not sure who came up
with this mnemonic, but you can remember that when
it comes to painted turtles, they are all hot chicks and cool dudes. For some tropical fish, the question
of will it be a boy or will it be a girl isn't settled until even later in life. You see, clownfish all start
out their lives as males, However, as they mature,
they become female. They also spend their lives in small
groups with a strict dominance hierarchy where only the most dominant
male and female reproduce. And amazingly, if the dominant
female in the group dies, the largest and most dominant male
will then quickly become female and take her place,
and all of the other males will move up one rank in the hierarchy. In another very different ocean animal, the green spoonworm, the sex of the babies is determined by a completely different aspect
of the environment. For this species, it is simply
a matter of where a larva happens to randomly fall on the sea floor. If a larva lands on the open sea floor,
then it will become a female. But if it lands on top of a female,
then it will become a male. So for some species,
the question of boy or girl is answered by genetics. For others, it's answered
by the environment. And for others still, they don't even
bother with the question at all. Take whiptail lizards, for example. For those desert lizards,
the answer is easy. It's a girl. It's always a girl. They are a nearly all-female species,
and although they still lay eggs, these eggs hatch out
female clones of themselves. So will it be a girl or will it be a boy? Throughout the entire animal kingdom, it does really all depend
on the system of sex determination. For humans, that system
is a genetic XY system. And for me and my wife, we found out it's going to be a baby boy. (Kiss)","The sex of a baby is determined by the sex determination system of the species.

In clownfish, all start as males and become females as they mature. In green spoonworms, the sex is determined by where the larva lands. In whiptail lizards, it's always a girl.

97,97,9OgidK7dRW0,How a fly flies - Michael Dickinson,"I grew up watching Star Trek I love Star Trek Star Trek wanted me it made me want to see alien creatures creatures from a far distant world but basically I figured out that I could find those alien creatures right on earth and what I do is I study insects I'm obsessed with insects particularly insect flight I think the I think the evolution of insect flight is perhaps one of the most important events in the history of life without insects there be no flowering plants without flowering plants there would be no clever of fruit eating primates giving TED talks now David and he Co and kotaki gave a very compelling story about the similarities between fruit flies and humans and there are many similarities and so you might think that if humans are similar to fruit flies the favorite behavior of a fruit fly might might be this for example but but in my talk I don't want to emphasize on the similarities between humans and fruit flies but rather the differences and focus on the behaviors that I think fruit flies excel at doing and so I want to show you a high-speed video sequence of a fly shot at 7,000 frames per second and infrared lighting and to the right off screen is an electronic looming predator that is going to go at the fly the fly is going to sense this predator it is going to extend its legs out it's going to sashay away to live to fly another day now I have carefully cropped this sequence to be exactly the duration of human eye blinks and the time that it would take you to blink your eye the fly has has seen this this looming predator estimated its position it initiated a a motor pattern to fly it away beating its wings at 220 times a second as it does so I think this is a fascinating behavior that shows how fast the fly's brain can process information now now flight what does it take to fly well in order to fly just as in a human aircraft you need wings that can generate sufficient aerodynamic for you need an engine sufficient to generate the power required for flight and you need a controller and in the first human aircraft the controller was basically that the brain of Orville and Wilbur I'm sitting in the cockpit now how does this compare to a fly well I spent a lot of my early career trying to figure out how insect wings generate enough force to keep the flies in the air and you might have heard how engineers proved that that that bumble bees couldn't fly well the problem was in thinking that the insect wings function the way that aircraft wings work but they don't and and we tackled this problem by building giant dynamically scaled model robot insects that would flap in in giant pools of mineral oil where we could study the aerodynamic forces and it turns out that the insects flapped their wings in a very clever way at a very high angle of attack that creates a structure at the leading edge of the wing a little tornado like structure called a leading-edge vortex and it's that that vortex that actually enables the wings to make enough force for the animal to stay in the air but the thing that's actually most so what's fascinating is not so much that the wing has some interesting morphology what's clever is the way the wing that the fly rather flaps it which of course ultimately is controlled by the the nervous system and this is what enables flies to perform these remarkable aerial maneuvers now what about the engine the engine of the flies absolutely fascinating they have two types of flight muscle so-called power muscle which is stretch activated which means that it activates itself and does not need to be controlled on a contraction by contraction basis by the nervous system it specialized to generate the the enormous power required for flight and it fills the middle portion of the fly so when a fly hits your windshield it's basically the power muscle that you're looking at but attached to the base of the wing is a set of little tiny control muscles that are that are not very powerful at all but they're very fast and they're able to reconfigure the hinge of the wing on a stroke by stroke basis and this is what enables the fly to change its wing and generate the the changes and aerodynamic forces which change its its flight trajectory and of course the role of the nervous system is to control all this so let's look at the controller now flies excel in the sorts of sensors that they carry to this problem they have antennae that sense odors and detect wind detection they have a sophisticated eye which is the fastest visual system on the planet they have another set of eyes on the top of their head we have no idea what they do they have a sensors on their on their their wing the wing is covered with with sensors including sensors that sense the deformation of the wing they can even taste with their wings one of the most sophisticated sensors a fly has is a structure called the hall tears the hall tears are actually gyroscopes these devices beat back and forth about 200 Hertz during flight and the animal can use them to sense its body rotation and initiate very very fast corrective maneuvers but all the sensory information has to be processed by a brain and yes indeed flies have a brain a brain of about a hundred thousand neurons now several people at this conference have already suggested that fruit flies could serve neuroscience because they're a simple model of brain function and the basic punchline of my talk is I'd like to turn that over on its head I don't think they're a simple model of anything and I think that flies are a great model they're a great model for flies and let's let's explore let's explore this notion of simplicity so I think unfortunately a lot of neuroscientists we're all somewhat narcissistic when we think of brain we of course imagine our own brain but remember that this kind of brain which is much much smaller instead of a hundred billion neurons it has a hundred thousand neurons but this is the most common form of brain on the planet and has been for 400 million years and is it fair to say that it's simple well it's simple in the sense that it has fewer neurons but is that a fair metric and I would propose it's not a fair metric so let's sort of think about this I think we have to compare we have to compare the size of the brain with what the brain can true can do so I propose we have a trump number and the Trump number is the ratio of of this man's behavioral repertoire to the number of neurons in his brain will calculate the Trump number for the fruit fly now how many people here think the Trump number is higher for the for the fruit fly it's it's a very smart smart audience yes the inequality goes in this direction or I would posit it now I realized that it is a little bit absurd to compare the behavioral repertoire of a human to a fly but let's take take another animal just as an example here's that here's a mouse a mouse has about a thousand times as many neurons as a fly I used to study mice when I study mice I used to talk really slowly and then something happened when I started to work on flies and I think if you compare if you compare it the natural history of flies and mice it's really comparable they have to forage for food they have to engage in courtship they they they they have sex they hide from predators they do a lot of the similar things but but I would argue that flies do more so for example I'm going to show you a sequence so they have to say some of my funding comes from the military so I'm showing this classified sequence and you cannot discuss it outside of this room ok so I want you to look at the payload at the tail of the fruit fly watch it very closely and you'll see why my six-year-old son now wants to be a neuroscientist wait for it so at least you'll admit that if fruit flies are not as clever as mice they're at least as clever as pigeons now I want to get across that it's not just a matter of numbers but but also the challenge for a fly to compute everything that brain has to compute with such tiny neurons so this is a beautiful image of a visual interneuron from a mouse that came from from Jeff Lichtman a lab and you could see that the wonderful images of brains that he showed in his in his talk but up in the corner in the right corner you'll see at the same scale of visual interneuron from a fly and I'll expand this up and it's a beautifully complex neuron it's just very very tiny and there's lots of biophysical challenges with trying to compute information with tiny tiny neurons how small can neurons get well look at this interesting insect it looks sort of like a fly it has wings that has eyes it has antennae its legs complicated life history it's a parasite it has to fly around and find caterpillars to parasitize but not only is its brain the size of a salt brain which is comparable for a fruit fly it is the size of a salt brain so a salt brain so here's some other organisms at the similar scale this animal is the size of a Paramecium and an amoeba and it has a brain of 7,000 neurons that's so small you know these things called cell bodies you've been hearing about where the nucleus of the neuron is this animal gets rid of them because they take up too much space so this is a session on frontiers in neuroscience I would posit that a front one frontier in neuroscience is to figure out how the brain of that thing works but let's think about this how can you make a small number of neurons do a lot and I think if from an engineering perspective you think of multiplexing you can take a hardware and have that hardware do different things at different times or have different parts of the hardware doing different things and these are the two concepts I'd like to explore and they're not concepts that I've come up with but concepts that have been proposed by others in the past and and one idea comes from lessons from chewing crabs and I don't mean chewing the crabs and I I grew up in Baltimore and I chew crabs very very well but I'm talking about the crabs I like doing the chewing crab chewing is actually really fascinating crabs have this complicated structure under their carapace called the gastric mill that grinds their food in a variety of different ways and here's an endoscopic movie of this of this this this this structure the amazing thing about this is that it's controlled by a really tiny set of neurons about two dozen neurons that can produce a vast variety of different motor patterns and the reason it can do this is that the this little tiny ganglion in the crab is actually inundated by many many neuromodulators you heard about neuromodulators earlier they're more neuromodulators that that alter that that innervate this structure then actually neurons in the structure and they're able to generate a complicated set set of patterns and this is the work by yves martyr and her many colleagues who've been studying this fascinating system that show how a small cluster of neurons can do many many many things because of neuromodulation that can take place on a moment-by-moment basis so this is basically multiplexing and time imagine a network of neurons with one neuromodulator you select one set of cells to perform one sort of behavior another neuromodulator another set of cells a different pattern and you can imagine you could extrapolate to a very very complicated system is there any evidence that flies do this well for many years in my laboratory and other laboratories around the world we've been studying fly behaviors and little flight simulators you can tether a fly to a little stick you can measure the aerodynamic forces it's creating you can let the ply it fly play a little video game by letting it fly around and in a visual display so let me show you a little tiny sequence of this here's a fly and enlarged infrared view of the fly in the flight simulator and this is the game the Flies love to play you allow them to steer towards a little stripe and they'll just steer towards that stripe forever it's part of their visual guidance system but very very recently it's been possible to modify these sorts of behavioral arenas for physiology so this is the preparation that one of my former postdocs gabby Mayman who's now at Rockefeller developed and it's basically a flight simulator but under conditions where you actually can stick and elect in the brain of the fly and record from a genetically I identified neuron in the fly's brain and this is what one of these experiments looks like it was a sequence taken from another postdoc in the lab Bettina schnell the green trace at the bottom is the membrane potential of a neuron in the fly's brain and you'll see the flies start to fly and the fly is actually controlling the rotation of that visual pattern itself by its own wing motion and you can see this visual interneuron respond to the pattern of wing motion as the fly flies so for the first time we've actually been able to record from neurons in the fly's brain while the fly is performing sophisticated behaviors such as such as flight and one of the lessons we've been learning is that the physiology of cells that we've been studying for many years in quiescent flies is not the same as the physiology of those cells when the Flies actually engaged in active behaviors like flying and walking and so forth and why is the the physiology different well it turns out it's these neuromodulators just like the neuromodulators in that little tiny ganglion in the crab so here's a picture of the october immune system octo commune as a neuromodulator that seems to play an important role in flight and other behaviors but this is just one of many neuromodulators that's in the fly's brain so I really think that as we we learn more it's going to turn out that the whole fly brain is just like a large version of the stomatogastric ganglion and that's one of the reasons why it can do so much with so few neurons now another idea another way of multiplexing is multiplexing in space having different parts of a neuron do different things at the same time so here's two sort of canonical neurons from a vertebrate and invertebrate a human pyramidal neuron from rimoni cahal and and another a cell to the right a non spiking inner neuron and this is the work of Alan Watson and Malcolm burrows many years ago and malcolm burrows came up with a pretty interesting idea based on the fact that this neuron from a locust does not fire action potentials it's a non spiking cell so a typical cell like the neurons in our brain has a region called the dendrites that receives input and that input somes together and will produce action potentials that run down the axon and then activate all the output regions of the neuron but non spiking neurons are actually quite complicated because they can have input synapses and output synapses all inter digitated and there's no single action potential that drives all the the outputs at the same time so there's a possibility that you have computational compartments that allow the different different neurons to do different of different parts of the neuron to do different things at the same time so these basic concepts of of multitasking and time a multitask in space I think these are things that are true in our brains as well but I think the insects are the true masters of this so I hope you think of insects a little bit differently next time and as I say up here please think before you swat you","The video is about the study of insect flight, specifically that of flies.

98,98,oz1Cz8ko8iY,The case of the vanishing honeybees - Emma Bryce,"There is an environmental mystery afoot, and it begins
with a seemingly trivial detail that reveals a disaster
of global proportions. One day, you notice that the honey
you slather on your morning toast is more expensive. Instead of switching to jam, you investigate the reason
for the price hike. What you find is shocking. The number of domesticated
honeybees in the US has been decreasing at an alarming rate. This decline appears too big to be explained by the usual causes
of bee death alone: disease, parasites or starvation. A typical crime scene
has almost no adult bees left in the hive, except, perhaps, a lonely queen
and a few other survivors. It's full of untouched food stores
and a brood of unborn larvae, suggesting that the adults vacated
without waiting for them to hatch. But what's particularly eerie is that there's no tell-tale mass
of dead or dying bees nearby. Either they have forgotten
their way back to the hive, or they have simply disappeared. These mysterious
disappearances aren't new. Humans have been collecting
honey for centuries. But it wasn't until European settlers
in the 1600's introduced the subspecies, 
Apis mellifera, that we domesticated bees. Since the 19th century, beekeepers have reported
occasional mass disappearances, giving them enigmatic names like disappearing disease,
spring dwindle disease and autumn collapse. But when in 2006 such losses 
were found to affect more than half of all hives in the US, the phenomenon got a new name: colony collapse disorder. The most frightening thing 
about this mystery isn't that we'll have to go back 
to using regular sugar in our tea. We farm bees for their honey, but they also pollinate our crops 
on an industrial scale, generating over 1/3 of America's 
food production this way. So, how can we find 
the culprit behind this calamity? Here are three of the possible offenders. Exhibit A: Pests and Disease. Most infamous is the varroa mite, a minuscule red pest that not only 
invades colonies and feeds on bees, but also transfers pathogens 
that stunt bee growth and shortens their life span. Exhibit B: Genetics. The queen is the core of a healthy hive. But nowadays, the millions 
of queen bees distributed in commercial hives are bred 
from just a few original queens, which raises the worry about 
a lack of genetic diversity which could weaken bees' defenses 
against pathogens and pests. Exhibit C: Chemicals. Pesticides used both
on commercial beehives and agricultural crops 
to ward off parasites could be getting into the food 
and water that honeybees consume. Researchers have even found
that some pesticides damage the honeybees' homing abilities. So we have a file full of clues but no clear leads. In reality, scientists, 
the actual detectives on this case, face disagreement over what causes 
colony collapse disorder. For now, we assume that 
several factors are the cause. Honeybees aren't necessarily 
in danger of extinction, but fewer bees overall means
less pollination and higher food costs, so it's crucial that scientists solve 
the case of the vanishing bees. Because while having less honey 
might be a buzzkill, crop shortages are something
that would truly sting.","The video talks about the mysterious disappearance of honeybees, known as colony collapse disorder. This phenomenon is a big problem because honeybees are essential for pollinating crops and producing honey. The video explores three possible causes of this disorder: pests and diseases, genetics, and chemicals. The varroa mite is a pest that feeds on bees and transfers pathogens that stunt bee growth. Genetic diversity is also a concern because queen bees are bred from a limited number of original queens. Chemicals, such as pesticides, could be getting into the food and water that honeybees consume, affecting their homing abilities. The video concludes by emphasizing the importance of solving the mystery of the vanishing bees to prevent crop shortages and higher food costs."
99,99,KI7u_pcfAQE,Dead stuff: The secret ingredient in our food chain - John C. Moore,"If someone called you scum, you'd probably be offended, but scientifically, they might not be far off. Have you ever thought about where your food comes from? You might say it comes from plants, animals, or even fungi, but you'd probably rather not think about the rotting organisms and poop that feed those plants, animals, and fungi. So really, you and most of the matter in your body are just two or three degrees of separation from things like pond scum. All species in an ecosystem, from the creatures in a coral reef to the fish in a lake to the lions on the savannah, are directly or indirectly nourished by dead stuff. Most of the organic matter in our bodies, if we trace it back far enough, comes from CO2 and water through photosynthesis. Plants use the energy from sunlight to transform carbon dioxide and water from the environment into glucose and oxygen. That glucose is then transformed into more complex organic molecules to form leaves, stems, roots, fruit, and so on. The energy stored in these organic molecules supports the food chains with which we're familiar. You've probably seen illustrations like this or this. These green food chains start with living plants at their base. But in real-life terrestrial ecosystems, less than 10% of plant matter is eaten while it's still alive. What about the other 90? Well, just look at the ground on an autumn day. Living plants shed dead body parts: fallen leaves, broken branches, and even underground roots. Many plants are lucky enough to go their whole lives without being eaten, eventually dying and leaving remains. All of these uneaten, undigested, and dead plant parts, that 90% of terrestrial plant matter? That becomes detritus, the base of what we call the brown food chain, which looks more like this. What happens to plants also happens to all other organisms up the food chain: some are eaten alive, but most are eaten only when they're dead and rotting. And all along this food chain, living things shed organic matter and expel digestive waste before dying and leaving their remains to decay. All that death sounds grim, right? But it's not. All detritus is ultimately consumed by microbes and other scavengers, so it actually forms the base of the brown food chain that supports many other organisms, including us. Scientists are learning that this detritus is an unexpectedly huge energy source, fueling most natural ecosystems. But the interactions within an ecosystem are even more complex than that. What a food chain really represents is a single pathway of energy flow. And within any ecosystem, many of these flows are linked together to form a rich network of interactions, or food web, with dead matter supporting that network at every step. The resulting food web is so connected that almost every species is no more than two degrees from detritus, even us humans. You probably don't eat rotting things, poop, or pond scum directly, but your food sources probably do. Many animals we eat either feed directly on detritus themselves, like pork, poultry, mushrooms, shellfish, or catfish and other bottom feeders, or they are fed animal by-products. So, if you're thinking nature is full of waste, you're right. But one organism's garbage is another's gold, and all that rotting dead stuff ultimately provides the energy that nourishes us and most of life on Earth, as it passes through the food web. Now that's some food for thought.","The video ""Dead stuff: The secret ingredient in our food chain"" by John C. Moore explains that most of the organic matter in our bodies comes from CO2 and water through photosynthesis. Plants use the energy from sunlight to transform carbon dioxide and water from the environment into glucose and oxygen. That glucose is then transformed into more complex organic molecules to form leaves, stems, roots, fruit, and so on. However, most of the plant matter is not eaten while it's still alive. Instead, it becomes detritus, the base of what we call the brown food chain, which supports many other organisms, including us. The video highlights that all detritus is ultimately consumed by microbes and other scavengers, forming the base of the brown food chain that supports many other organisms, including us.

Curious facts:

* Most of the organic matter in our bodies comes from CO2 and water through photosynthesis.
* Less than 10% of plant matter is eaten while it's still alive.
* The brown food chain is fueled by detritus, the base of which is made up of uneaten, undigested, and dead plant parts.
* All detritus is ultimately consumed by microbes and other scavengers.
* Almost every species is no more than two degrees from detritus, even us humans.
* Many animals we eat either feed directly on detritus or are fed animal by-products.
* One organism's garbage is another's gold, and all that rotting dead stuff ultimately provides the energy that nourishes us and most of life on Earth, as it passes through the food web."
