0,0,W9wAfqBd_T0,How turtle shells evolved... twice - Judy Cebra Thomas,"Meet Odontochelys semitestacea. This little creature spends its days 
splashing in Late Triassic swamps with a host of other reptiles. Under the surface lies its best 
defense against attack: a hard shell on its belly. Odontochelys is an early ancestor 
of the turtle. Its half-shelled body illustrates an 
important point about the modern turtle: it actually has two shells that develop 
totally separately while the turtle is still an embryo. Both are extensions of the animal’s 
skeleton, and together they are made 
of almost 60 bones. Like other embryos, turtle embryos are made of 
undifferentiated cells that become specific cell types, and then organs and tissues, through gene activity and communication
between cells. At first, turtle embryos look very similar
to those of other reptiles, birds, and mammals, except for a bulge of cells called 
the carapacial ridge. The ridge expands around the body 
between the neck and lower back, creating a disc shape. It guides the formation of the upper part
of the turtle’s shell, called the carapace, likely by attracting 
the cells that will become ribs. Instead of curving downwards 
to make a regular rib cage, the ribs move outwards towards the 
carapacial ridge. They then secrete a signaling protein that converts surrounding cells 
into bone-forming cells. These fifty bones grow until they meet 
and connect with sutures. A ring of bone solidifies 
the carapace’s edges. The outer layer of skin cells produces 
the scales, known as scutes, that cover the carapace. The development of the bottom half 
of the shell, the plastron, is driven by neural crest cells, which can produce a variety of different 
cell types including neurons, cartilage and bone. A thick shield of these cells 
spreads across the belly, coming together in regions that produce
nine plate-like bones. Eventually, these connect to the 
carapace by sutures. A turtle’s shell has obvious advantages
for guarding against predators, but the rigid casing also presents 
some challenges. As the turtle grows, the sutures between the bones 
of the carapace and plastron spread. Most mammals and reptiles rely on a
flexible rib cage that expands to allow them to breathe, but turtles use abdominal muscles 
attached to the shell instead: one to breathe in, 
and one to breathe out. So how did the shell evolve? Though there are still gaps in the 
fossil record, the first step seems to have been 
a thickening of the ribs. The oldest known turtle ancestor, a creature called Eunotosaurus africanus, lived 260 million years ago and looked 
almost nothing like a modern turtle, but it had a set of broad, flat ribs that anchored the muscles 
of its powerful forearms. Eunotosaurus was likely 
a burrowing creature, digging homes for itself in what’s 
now southern Africa. Odontochelys semitestacea illustrates 
another, later step in turtle evolution, with thick ribs like Eunotosaurus 
plus a belly plate for protection. Our first fossil evidence of the full 
shell characteristic of modern turtles is about 210 million years old, and belongs to a species called 
Proganochelys quenstedti, whose ribs had fused. Proganochelys could move 
between water and land. Unlike modern turtles, it couldn’t retract
its head into its shell, but had defensive spines on its neck. Modern turtle shells are almost as diverse
as the turtles themselves. Sea turtles have flatter, lighter shells 
for streamlined gliding through the water. Land-dwelling tortoises, meanwhile, have domed shells that can slip free of
predators’ jaws and help them turn right-side up if 
they fall on their backs. Leatherback and softshell turtles have shells without the ring of bone 
around the edge of the carapace or the tough scutes covering it, making it easier for them to 
squeeze into tight spaces.","The video discusses the evolution of turtle shells, which have two separate shells that develop independently while the turtle is still an embryo. The upper shell, or carapace, is made of 50 bones that form from a bulge of cells called the carapacial ridge. The lower shell, or plastron, is made of nine plate-like bones that are produced by neural crest cells. The shell provides protection for turtles, but also presents challenges for breathing. The video also mentions that the first known turtle ancestor, Eunotosaurus africanus, had broad, flat ribs that anchored the muscles of its powerful forearms.

Curious facts:

* Turtles have two separate shells that develop independently while they are still embryos.
* The upper shell, or carapace, is made of 50 bones that form from a bulge of cells called the carapacial ridge.
* The lower shell, or plastron, is made of nine plate-like bones that are produced by neural crest cells.
* The shell provides protection for turtles, but also presents challenges for breathing.
* The first known turtle ancestor, Eunotosaurus africanus, had broad, flat ribs that anchored the muscles of its powerful forearms.
* Modern turtle shells are almost as diverse as the turtles themselves, with different shapes and features for different species."
1,1,Cd-artSbpXc,Why are fish fish-shaped? - Lauren Sallan,"In tropical seas, flying fish leap out of the water, gliding for up to 200 meters 
using wing-like fins, before dipping back into the sea. In the Indo-Pacific, a hunting sailfish can reach speeds 
of 110 kilometers per hour. That’s 11 times faster than Olympic 
swimming champion Michael Phelps. It can then stick up its spiny dorsal fin 
like a brake, grinding to a dead halt, mid-swim. Each of these physical feats is made 
possible by a fish’s form, which in most species is a smooth, 
elongated body, fins, and a tail. These features are shared across thousands
of fish species, each introducing its own variations on
the theme to survive in unique habitats. What makes these features so
commonplace in fish, and what does it reveal about the more 
than 33,000 fish species that inhabit earth’s rivers, 
lakes, and seas? Fish can be split into two main groups, according to the type 
of motion they favor. The first is body 
and caudal fin driven motion, and most fish species, about 85%, 
fall into this group. Here, the body and tail 
are the primary propelling forces, with fins mainly playing 
a stabilizing and steering role. This configuration suits 
many open-water species, which need speed, thrust and control for
constant, efficient swimming. Eels lie at one extreme of this group. Known as anguilliform swimmers, their entire bodies undulate to generate 
a wave-like motion. Compared to anguilliform fish, species like salmon and trout, 
known as subcarangiforms, use about two-thirds of their body mass
to generate motion, while carangiform swimmers, 
such as mackerel, only use about a third. Typically, the less of its mass a fish 
uses to generate motion, the more streamlined its shape. At the other end of the spectrum from eels
are ostraciiform species like boxfish, and thunniform swimmers like tuna. In these fish, the tails, 
also known as caudal fins, do the work. A tuna’s tail is attached by tendons 
to multiple muscles in its body. It powers the body like an engine, forcefully catapulting
the bullet-like fish to speeds up to 69 kilometers per hour. The second major fish group relies 
on median and paired fin motion, meaning they’re propelled through the 
water predominantly by their fins. Fins allow fine-tuned movement 
at slow speeds, so this propulsion 
is typically found in fish that have to navigate complex habitats. Bottom-dwelling fishes, like rays,
fall into this group; using their huge pectoral fins, they can
lift themselves swiftly off the sea floor. That conveniently allows them 
to inhabit shallow seas without being buffeted about by waves. Similarly, shallow-water flatfish 
use their entire bodies as one big fin to hoist 
themselves up off the sand. Ocean sunfish lack tails, so they move around slowly by beating 
their wing-like median fins instead. Similar movements are shared 
by many reef species, like the queen angelfish, surgeonfish, and wrasse. Their focus on fins has taken 
the demand off their bodies, many of which have consequently 
evolved into unusual and inventive shapes. There are fishes within both groups 
that seem to be outliers. But if you look closer, you’ll notice that these 
common traits are disguised. Seahorses, for instance, don’t appear 
fish-shaped in any conventional way, yet they use their flexible 
dorsal fins as makeshift tails. A pufferfish may occasionally 
look more like a lethal balloon, but if it needs to swim rapidly,
it’ll retract its spines. Handfish look like they have legs, but really these limb-like 
structures are fins, modified to help them 
amble across the sea floor. For fish, motion underpins survival, so it’s become a huge evolutionary 
driver of form. The widespread features of fish 
have been maintained across tens of thousands of fish species, not to mention other 
ocean-dwelling animals, like penguins, dolphins, sea slugs, and squids. And that’s precisely because 
they’ve proven so successful.","Fish have evolved to have a specific shape that allows them to move efficiently in water.

2,2,_hBAr7uJ6L8,The surprising reasons animals play dead - Tierney Thys,"Imagine you’re being attacked 
by a ferocious predator. With no chance of escape, you do what any courageous, 
self-respecting possum would do: curl into an immobile 
state called catatonia, stick out your tongue, drool, and ooze some foul-smelling 
liquid from your anal glands. Disgusted, your assailant 
loosens its grip, decides you’re not the dinner 
it was looking for, and departs. After 10 minutes, 
you resurrect and merrily saunter on. From lemurs to lizards, ants to amphibians, sharks to chickens, hundreds of animals
""play dead"" as a survival tactic. Nicknamed ""playing possum"" 
after its star performer, feigning death is also called thanatosis. That’s from Thanatos, 
the ancient Greek deity of death. But most scientists call it 
tonic immobility, or TI. How and why TI occurs depends 
on the species and situation. Spewing stench and adopting odd postures
are common and often play important roles. Other animals sacrifice their neighbors: quail chicks that freeze 
while their kin run amok have a better chance of survival 
when pursued by a cat. Speaking of cats, feline mothers can pinch
the napes of their kittens’ necks and induce another kind of 
immobility called clipnosis. This keeps their kittens quiet 
and easy to transport. Most of the physiological mechanisms 
underlying these theatrics originate in 
the parasympathetic nervous system, better known for controlling cycles 
of resting and digesting. In possums, the parasympathetic nervous system causes
their heart rates to drop by nearly half, respiration by a third, and body temperatures by more than half a
degree Celsius for up to an hour. The neurotransmitter dopamine 
also plays a part. Flour beetles with low dopamine levels 
play dead more frequently than those with high levels, and anything blocking dopamine receptor 
sites can lengthen catatonia. But maintaining a death ruse isn’t easy. The performers are constantly 
gauging their surroundings for cues on when it’s safe to rise. Chickens, for instance, can sense
when a predator’s eyes are upon them. Researchers know this because when they
used a stuffed hawk in an experiment, their chicken subjects came out of their
catatonia quicker when the hawk’s eyes were averted. Other animals use TI for purposes 
other than defense. When the sleeper cichlid feels peckish, it sinks to the lake floor 
and lies motionless, its splotchy coloration making it 
seem like a rotting carcass. If a small scavenger investigates, 
this undead trickster strikes. Some animals even feign death 
as a sexual ploy. Male nursery spiders offer gifts of
silk-wrapped insects in hopes of wooing females. But those females are known 
to eat love-seeking males. By playing dead while the female 
eagerly devours her snack, these males can cautiously revive and improve their chances 
of successfully mating. So TI can work to an animal’s advantage,
unless someone else knows its secret. California orcas can flip over 
young great white sharks, inducing TI for so long 
the immobilized sharks, who must move to respire, 
essentially suffocate. Humans can also flip sharks into TI. By stroking a shark’s 
electrically-sensitive snout and gently turning it over, researchers can induce TI 
that lasts up to 15 minutes. That’s enough time to insert tags, remove hooks, and even perform surgeries. There are risks however: TI can hamper respiration and induce
hyperglycemia, a sign of stress. So this technique should only 
be used when necessary. Humans can also experience TI when they
freeze with fear during violent assaults. Recognizing this ancient, involuntary
form of self-defense has significant implications 
when trying to understand why some victims don’t flee 
or fight in the face of danger. So, studying TI in non-human animals not only helps us better understand some
odd behaviors, it can also help us better 
understand our own, sometimes counterintuitive, responses to violence.","Did you know that many animals play dead as a survival tactic? This behavior is called thanatosis or tonic immobility (TI).

3,3,uSTNyHkde08,Why isn't the world covered in poop? - Eleanor Slade and Paul Manning,"Somewhere near you, 
an animal is defecating. In fact, each day, the animal kingdom 
produces roughly enough dung to match the volume of water pouring 
over the Victoria Falls. So why isn’t the planet covered 
in the stuff? You can thank the humble dung beetle 
for eating up the excess. Capable of burying 250 times 
their body weight in a single night, these valiant insects make
quick work of an endless stream of feces. Over 7,000 known species of dung beetle 
run clean-up duty across six continents —everywhere except Antarctica. A dung beetle’s first task 
is to locate dung. Some live on the anal regions 
of larger animals, ready to leap off when they defecate. Others sniff out feces 
that animals leave behind. A pile of elephant dung can attract 
4,000 beetles in 15 minutes. So once a beetle finds dung, it must work quickly to secure 
some of the bounty for itself. Most dung beetle species fall into one 
of three main groups: rollers, tunnelers, and dwellers. Dung rollers sculpt a ball of dung,
and using their back legs, quickly roll it away from competitors. Potential partners jump on the ball, and once the ball-maker 
has selected their mate, the pair dig their dung ball 
into the soil. Once it’s been buried, the female lays 
a single egg within the dung ball. Tunnelers have a different approach. Digging underneath a pat, 
some drag dung down into the soil and pack it into clumps 
known as brood balls, dung balls, or dung “sausages,” 
depending on their shape and size. Male tunnelers sport a spectacular 
array of horns to fight each other
for control of these tunnels, which they then defend 
until the female’s laid her egg. Some male tunnelers avoid the fray
by masquerading as hornless females and sneaking into tunnels to mate 
while the guardians’ heads are turned. The third group of dung beetles, dwellers, take the most straightforward approach, laying their eggs
directly into a dung pat. This makes their offspring
more vulnerable to predation than those of the tunnelers and rollers. As the larvae feed, they riddle 
the dung pat with tunnels, leaving remains that are quickly colonized
by bacteria and fungi and weathered away. Inside a tunnel, ball, or pat, 
once the larvae hatch, they consume the dung 
before metamorphosing into a pupa and then an adult beetle. Besides clearing dung, 
the actions of these beetles have considerable ecological importance. For one, they serve as secondary 
seed dispersers. Dung from monkeys, wild pigs, and other animals is riddled with seeds 
from the fruits they eat. When beetles bury their dung balls, they inadvertently protect these seeds 
from predators and increase the likelihood 
they’ll germinate. The advantage is so great 
that one South African plant has evolved to produce seeds that look 
and smell like dung to trick beetles into burying them. Dung beetles also play important roles 
in agricultural systems. Livestock, like cows and sheep,
produce huge amounts of dung, which contains nutrients 
that can benefit plants. The beetles break up the dung 
and tunnel it deep into the soil, bringing the nutrients into close contact
with plant roots. Their services to farmers have been valued
at $380 million a year in the US and £367 million a year in the UK. Dung beetles can even help us battle 
global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions
associated with farming. Microbes living in oxygen-poor 
livestock dung produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas. But beetles oxygenate pats when 
they tunnel into them, preventing the microbes
from producing methane. The dung beetle spreads seeds, helps farmers, and fights climate change —and accomplishes it all
simply by doing its business. Maybe next time you come across 
some dung in the forest or a field, you’ll be tempted to take a closer look.","Dung beetles are responsible for cleaning up the animal kingdom's waste. They bury dung to eat and lay eggs in, and their actions have ecological importance. They serve as secondary seed dispersers and help agricultural systems by bringing nutrients into contact with plant roots.

4,4,-64U7WoBrqM,Why are sloths so slow? - Kenny Coogan,"In 1796, Thomas Jefferson received
a box of bones he couldn't identify. A long, sharp claw reminded him of a lion, but the arm bones 
suggested a larger animal, one about three meters long. Thinking it might be huge unknown
species of North American lion, Jefferson warned explorers Lewis and Clark to keep an eye out 
for this mysterious predator. But Jefferson's box of bones didn't
come from a lion. They came from an extinct giant sloth. Prehistoric ground sloths first appeared
around 35 million years ago. Dozens of species lived across
North, Central and South America, alongside other ancient creatures
like mastodons and giant armadillos. Some ground sloths, like the megalonychid,
were cat-sized, but many were massive. Jefferson's sloth, Megalonyx,
weighed about a ton, and that was small 
compared to megatherium, which could reach six metric tons,
as much as an elephant. They ambled through the forests
and savannas using their strong arms and sharp claws to uproot plants and climb trees, grazing on grasses, leaves,
and prehistoric avocados. In fact, we might not have avocados
today if not for the giant sloths. Smaller animals couldn't swallow
the avocado's huge seed, but the sloths could, and they spread avocado trees
far and wide. Ground sloths flourished for millions
of years, but around 10,000 years ago,
they started disappearing along with the Western Hemisphere's
other giant mammals. Researchers think that ground sloths
could have been pushed out by an oncoming ice age, or competition with other species,
maybe humans, who arrived in the region around the time
most of the sloths went extinct. Some of the smaller sloths did survive
and migrated to the treetops. Today, there are six species left
living in the rainforest canopies of Central and South America. Hanging out in the trees is a good way
to avoid predators, and there are plenty of leaves to eat. But this diet has its drawbacks. Animals extract energy from food
and use that energy to move around, maintain their body temperature, keep their organs working, and all the other activities necessary
for survival. But leaves don't contain much energy, and that which they do have
is tough to extract. Most herbivores supplement a leafy diet
with higher energy foods like fruit and seeds. But sloths, especially three-toed sloths,
rely on leaves almost exclusively. They've evolved finely tuned strategies
for coping with this restricted diet. First, they extract as much energy from
their food as possible. Sloths have a multi-chambered stomach
that takes up a third of their body, and depending on the species, they can spend five to seven days,
or even weeks, processing a meal. The other piece of the puzzle
is to use as little energy as possible. One way sloths do this is, of course,
by not moving very much. They spend most of their time eating,
resting, or sleeping. They descend from the canopy just once
a week for a bathroom break. When sloths do move, it's not very fast. It would take a sloth about five minutes
to cross an average neighborhood street. This unhurried approach to life means
that sloths don't need very much muscle. In fact, they have about 30% less
muscle mass than other animals their size. Sloths also use less energy 
to keep themselves warm because their body temperature
can fluctuate by about five degrees Celsius, less than a cold-blooded reptile,
but more than most mammals. These physical and behavioral adaptations 
minimize the sloth's energy expenditure, or metabolic rate. Three-toed sloths have the slowest 
metabolism of any mammal. The giant panda is second slowest, and two-toed sloths come in third. Moving slowly has allowed sloths
to thrive in their treetop habitat. But it's also made the sloths themselves
a great habitat for other organisms, including algae, which provides a little
extra camouflage, and maybe even a snack. Sloths may not be giant anymore, but that doesn't make 
them any less remarkable.","Sloths are slow-moving creatures that have evolved to survive on a diet of leaves. They have a unique digestive system that allows them to extract as much energy as possible from their food, and they use less energy to keep themselves warm.

5,5,vcPJkz-D5II,The evolution of animal genitalia - Menno Schilthuizen,"The evolutionary tango 
of animal genitalia. Can you guess what you're looking at? If you answered ""duck vagina,""
you'd be right. Although the bird's outward appearance
may not strike you as especially odd, it uses this strange, intricate, cork-screw shaped contraption 
to reproduce. We see similarly unbelievable genitalia
in insects, mammals, reptiles, fish, spiders, and even snails. Apparently, no organs evolve
faster and into more variable shapes than those involved in procreation. Superficially, it makes sense
because evolution works via reproduction. When an animal leaves more offspring,
its genes will spread. And since genitalia are an animal's tools
for reproduction, any improvement there 
will have immediate effect. And yet, what's the point of having
such decorative nether regions? After all, the function 
of genitalia seems simple. A penis deposits a bit of sperm and a vagina receives it 
and delivers it to the egg. A pipette-like thingy on the male and a funnel-like gizmo on the female
should do just fine for any animal. And yet, that's not what we see. The penis of a chicken flea, for example,
looks nothing like a pipette, more like an exploded grandfather clock. And the vagina of a featherwing beetle resembles something you'd find
in a Dr. Seuss book. Throughout the animal kingdom, genitalia are very complex things, much more complicated than seems
necessary for what they're meant to do. That's because genitalia do more than just
deposit and receive sperm. Many male animals also use the penis
as courtship device, like crane flies. In some South American species, males have a tiny washboard and scraper
on their penis, which produces a song that reverberates
throughout the female's body when they mate. It's thought that if female crane flies
enjoy this unusual serenade, they'll allow the male 
to father their offspring. This way, the genes of the most
musical penises spread, leading to rapid evolution
of insects' phalluses. Similarly, some beetles have two little
drumsticks on either side of the penis. During mating, they'll rub, slap, or tap
the female with these. And some hoofed mammals,
like rams and bulls, use a whip-like extension 
on the penis's left side to create a sensation during mating. But how can females really choose
between males if she can only assess them after mating? This is where the power
of female adaptation comes into play. In fact, insemination is different
to conception, and the female genitalia exploit
this distinction. For instance, in some dung flies, the vagina contains pockets
for separating sperm from different males depending on how appealing they were. Males using their penises for courtship and females controlling 
their own sperm management are two reasons why genitalia evolve
into such complex shapes. But there are others because genitalia are also where
a sexual conflict is played out. A female's interests are best served if
she fertilizes her eggs with the sperm of the best fathers and creates genetic variability amongst
her offspring. For a male, on the other hand,
this is bad news. For him, it would be best if a female
used his sperm to fertilize all of her eggs. So we see cycles of adaptation
in an evolutionary arms race to retain control. Black widow spiders 
have a disposable penis tip that breaks off inside the vagina
blocking the attempts of his rivals, and bed bug males bypass a female's
genitalia altogether using a syringe-like penis to inject
sperm cells directly into her belly. Not to be outdone, females have evolved 
their own countermeasures. In some bed bug species, the females have evolved an entirely
new set of genitalia on their right hand flanks
where the males usually pierce them. That allows them to maintain
the power to filter out unwanted sperm with their genitalia. And duck vaginas are shaped
like a clockwise spiral so that when the male inflates his long,
counterclockwise coiled penis into her, and she disapproves, all she needs to do 
is flex her vaginal muscles and the penis just flubs out. So, genitalia differs so much,
not just to fascinate us, but because in every species, they're the result of 
a furious evolutionary tango of sex that has been going on
for millions of years and will continue for millions 
of years to come.","The evolution of animal genitalia is a fascinating topic that has been shaped by millions of years of evolution. Genitalia are not just for reproduction but also for courtship and sperm management. Males use their penises for courtship, while females have developed complex vaginas to control sperm and filter out unwanted sperm. This has led to an evolutionary arms race between males and females, with each trying to gain control over the other. The result is a diverse range of genitalia across different species, each with its unique features and functions.

6,6,IxndOd3kmSs,"Meet the tardigrade, the toughest animal on Earth - Thomas Boothby","Without water, a human can only
survive for about 100 hours. But there's a creature so resilient
that it can go without it for decades. This one millimeter animal can survive
both the hottest and coldest environments on Earth, and can even withstand high levels
of radiation. This is the tardigrade, and it's one of the toughest creatures
on Earth, even if it does look more like
a chubby, eight-legged gummy bear. Most organisms need water to survive. Water allows metabolism to occur, which is the process that drives
all the biochemical reactions that take place in cells. But creatures like the tardigrade,
also known as the water bear, get around this restriction
with a process called anhydrobiosis, from the Greek meaning
life without water. And however extraordinary,
tardigrades aren't alone. Bacteria, single-celled organisms called archaea, plants, and even other animals 
can all survive drying up. For many tardigrades, this requires that they go through 
something called a tun state. They curl up into a ball, pulling their head and eight legs
inside their body and wait until water returns. It's thought that as water
becomes scarce and tardigrades enter their tun state, they start synthesize special molecules, which fill the tardigrade's cells
to replace lost water by forming a matrix. Components of the cells that are
sensitive to dryness, like DNA, proteins, and membranes, get trapped in this matrix. It's thought that this keeps these
molecules locked in position to stop them from unfolding, breaking apart, or fusing together. Once the organism is rehydrated,
the matrix dissolves, leaving behind undamaged, 
functional cells. Beyond dryness, tardigrades can also
tolerate other extreme stresses: being frozen, heated up past the boiling point
of water, high levels of radiation, and even the vacuum of outer space. This has led to some erroneous speculation that tardigrades 
are extraterrestrial beings. While that's fun to think about, scientific evidence places their
origin firmly on Earth where they've evolved over time. In fact, this earthly evolution 
has given rise to over 1100 known species of tardigrades and there are probably many others
yet to be discovered. And because tardigrades are so hardy,
they exist just about everywhere. They live on every continent,
including Antarctica. And they're in diverse biomes
including deserts, ice sheets, the sea, fresh water, rainforests, and the highest mountain peaks. But you can find tardigrades
in the most ordinary places, too, like moss or lichen found in yards, parks, and forests. All you need to find them is a little
patience and a microscope. Scientists are now to trying to find out
whether tardigrades use the tun state, their anti-drying technique, to survive other stresses. If we can understand how they,
and other creatures, stabilize their sensitive 
biological molecules, perhaps we could apply this knowledge
to help us stabilize vaccines, or to develop stress-tolerant crops that

to the vacuum of outer space, scientists can generate clues about
the environmental limits of life and how to safeguard astronauts. In the process, tardigrades could even
help us answer a critical question: could life survive on planets much
less hospitable than our own?","The tardigrade, also known as the water bear, is one of the toughest animals on Earth. It can survive without water for decades and withstand extreme temperatures, radiation, and even the vacuum of outer space. This is possible due to a process called anhydrobiosis, which allows the tardigrade to survive drying up by curling up into a ball and synthesizing special molecules that protect its cells. Tardigrades can be found everywhere, from Antarctica to the highest mountain peaks, and even in ordinary places like moss and lichen. Scientists are studying tardigrades to learn how they survive extreme stresses and how this knowledge can be applied to develop stress-tolerant crops and safeguard astronauts.

* Tardigrades can survive without water for decades.
* Tardigrades can withstand extreme temperatures, radiation, and the vacuum of outer space.
* Tardigrades have a special process called anhydrobiosis that allows them to survive drying up.

7,7,VgEbcQxFUu8,Why do we harvest horseshoe crab blood? - Elizabeth Cox,"During the warmer months,
especially at night during the full moon, horseshoe crabs emerge 
from the sea to spawn. Waiting for them are teams
of lab workers who capture the horseshoe crabs
by the hundreds of thousands, take them to labs, harvest their cerulean blood, then return them to the sea. Oddly enough, we capture horseshoe crabs
on the beach because that's the only place
we know we can find them. A female horseshoe crab lays as many
as 20 batches of up to 4,000 eggs on her annual visit to the beach. When the eggs hatch, the juvenile horseshoe crabs
often stay near shore, periodically shedding their shells
as they grow. Once they leave 
these shallow waters, they don't return until they
reach sexual maturity ten years later. Despite our best efforts, we don't
know where they spend those years. Though we've spotted the occasional 
horseshoe crab as deep as 200 meters below
the ocean's surface, we only see large groups of adults
when they come ashore to spawn. Horseshoe crab blood contains
cells called amebocytes that protect them 
from infection by viruses, fungi, and bacteria. Amebocytes form gels around
these invaders to prevent them from spreading infections. This isn't unusual. All animals have protective 
immune systems. But horseshoe crab amebocytes
are exceptionally sensitive to bacterial endotoxins. Endotoxins are molecules
from the cell walls of certain bacteria, including E. coli. Large amounts of them are released
when bacterial cells die, and they can make us sick
if they enter the blood stream. Many of the medicines and medical devices
we rely on can become contaminated, so we have to test them
before they touch our blood. We do have tests called Gram stains
that detect bacteria, but they can't recognize endotoxins which can be there even when
bacteria aren't present. So scientists use an extract called LAL produced from harvested 
horseshoe crab blood to test for endotoxins. They add LAL to a medicine sample,
and if gels form, bacterial endotoxins are present. Today, the LAL test is used so widely that millions of people who've
never seen a horseshoe crab have been protected by their blood. If you've ever had an injection,
that probably includes you. How did horseshoe crabs end up
with such special blood? Like other invertebrates, the horseshoe crab has an open
circulatory system. This means their blood isn't contained
in blood vessels, like ours. Instead, horseshoe crab blood
flows freely through the body cavity and comes in direct contact with tissues. If bacteria enters their blood,
it can quickly spread over a large area. Pair this vulnerability with the horseshoe crab's bacteria-filled 
ocean and shoreline habitats, and it's easy to see why they need
such a sensitive immune response. Horseshoe crabs survived 
mass extinction events that wiped out over 90% of life on Earth
and killed off the dinosaurs, but they're not invincible. And the biggest disruptions they've faced
in millions of years come from us. Studies have shown that up to
15% of horseshoe crabs die in the process of having
their blood harvested. And recent research suggests
this number may be even higher. Researchers have also observed
fewer females returning to spawn at some of the most harvested areas. Our impact on horseshoe crabs extends
beyond the biomedical industry, too. Coastal development 
destroys spawning sites, and horseshoe crabs are also
killed for fishing bait. There's ample evidence that
their populations are shrinking. Some researchers have started working to synthesize horseshoe crab 
blood in the lab. For now, we're unlikely to stop
our beach trips, but hopefully, a synthetic alternative
will someday eliminate our reliance on the blood of these ancient creatures.","Horseshoe crabs have unique blood that contains cells called amebocytes, which protect them from infection by forming gels around bacteria. The blood is harvested for its ability to detect bacterial endotoxins in medical equipment, protecting millions of people. However, harvesting the blood kills up to 15% of the crabs, and coastal development and fishing further threaten their populations. Researchers are working on synthesizing the blood in the lab to reduce the need for harvesting.

Curious facts:

* Horseshoe crabs have been around for over 450 million years and survived mass extinction events that killed off the dinosaurs.
* Female horseshoe crabs lay up to 4,000 eggs per batch and can spawn 20 batches in a year.

8,8,r5_ZSnFDPRg,The surprising reason birds sing - Partha P. Mitra,"This is a song sung by a brown thrasher. But that’s just one of the thousand 
or more that it knows, and it’s not the only avian virtuoso. A wood thrush can sing 
two pitches at once. A mockingbird can match the sounds 
around it, including car alarms. And the Australian superb lyrebird has an incredible, elaborate song 
and dance ritual. These are just a few of 
the 4,000 species of songbirds. Most birds produce short, simple calls, but songbirds also have 
a repertoire of complex vocal patterns that help them attract mates, defend territory, and strengthen their social bonds. Each songbird species 
has its own distinct song patterns, some with characteristic 
regional dialects. Experienced listeners can even distinguish
individual birds by their unique songs. So how do birds learn these songs 
in the first place? How do they know to mimic the songs 
of their own species? Are they born knowing how to sing? A lot of what scientists know about bird
song comes from studying zebra finches. A baby male zebra finch typically learns 
to sing from its father or other males, starting while it’s still 
a fledgling in the nest. First comes a sensory learning phase, when the baby finch hears the songs
sung around it and commits them to memory. The bird starts to vocalize 
during the motor learning phase, practicing until it can 
match the song it memorized. As the bird learns, hearing 
the tutor’s song over and over again is helpful—
up to a point. If he hears it too many times, the
imitation degrades— and the source matters. If the song is played 
through a loudspeaker, he can’t pick it up as easily. But hide the same loudspeaker inside 
a toy painted to look like a zebra finch, and his learning improves. What if the baby never hears another 
zebra finch’s song? Interestingly enough, it’ll sing anyway. Isolated finches still produce 
what are called innate or isolate songs. A specific tune might be taught, but the instinct to sing seems
to be hardwired into a songbird’s brain. Innate songs sound different from
the “cultured” songs learned from other finches—at first. If isolated zebra finches 
start a new colony, the young birds pick up 
the isolate song from their parents. But the song changes 
from generation to generation. And after a few iterations, the melody actually starts to resemble the cultured songs sung 
by zebra finches in the wild. Something about the learning process 
must be hardwired, too, drawing the birds towards the
same song patterns again and again. This means that basic information 
about the zebra finch song must be stored somewhere 
in its genome, imprinted there by millions 
of years of evolution. At first, this might seem odd, as we usually think of genetic code as a
source of biochemical or physical traits, not something like a behavior or action. But the two aren’t 
fundamentally different; we can connect genomes to
behavior through brain circuitry. The connection is noisy and quite complex. It doesn’t simply map single genes 
to single behaviors, but it exists. Genomes contain codes for proteins 
that guide brain development, such as molecules that guide the pathways
of developing axons, shaping distinct circuits. Birds’ brains 
have so-called “song circuits” that are active when the birds sing. These circuits also respond to the song 
of a bird’s own species more strongly than
to other species’ songs. So the theory is that a bird’s genes 
guide development of brain circuits that relate to singing 
and the ability to learn songs. Then, exposure to songs 
shapes those neural circuits to produce the songs 
that are typical to that species. Genetically encoded or innate behaviors 
aren’t unique to songbirds. They’re widespread in the animal kingdom. Spectacular examples include the long-distance migrations 
of monarch butterflies and salmon. So what does this mean for humans? Are we also born with innate 
information written into our genomes that helps shape our neural circuits, and ultimately results 
in something we know? Could there be some knowledge that is unique 
and intrinsic to humans as a species?","Birds sing songs to attract mates, defend territory, and strengthen social bonds.

9,9,rcAN4rkTmNU,The life cycle of the butterfly - Franziska Bauer,"In order to become a butterfly, a caterpillar’s body dissolves 
almost completely and is rebuilt from its own juices. As inconvenient and even downright 
dangerous as this process sounds, it’s actually quite common. Butterflies are just a few of 
the 800,000 insect species that transition from larvae to adults 
through complete metamorphosis. That’s approximately 85% of insects 
and 70% of all known animal species. But how exactly does 
a caterpillar become a butterfly? When a caterpillar hatches 
from an egg, it has none of a butterfly’s 
physical traits. It does have groups of cells
inside its body called imaginal discs that will eventually 
become its butterfly parts. For now, these cells remain dormant. Juvenile hormone suppresses 
their activity, and prevents the caterpillar
from beginning metamorphosis too early. Immediately after hatching,
the caterpillar begins to feed, building up fat until its rigid skin,
called a cuticle, becomes too tight. At this point, a hormone called ecdysone 
triggers the cuticle to shed, or molt. As the caterpillar grows, 
it usually molts four times. Then, when it’s nice and plump, the caterpillar’s levels 
of juvenile hormone drop, which triggers it to stop
eating and moving. A final burst of ecdysone prompts the caterpillar’s cells 
to begin to self-destruct. Soon, the muscles, fat, and other tissues 
are almost entirely liquefied, though the imaginal discs stay intact
and begin to grow. At the same time, a second skin layer 
called the pupal cuticle forms underneath the first. One more molt exposes 
the hard exterior of the pupa. Besides the imaginal discs, 
only a few tissues are spared, including parts of the respiratory system, the heart, some abdominal muscles, and the mushroom bodies of the brain. The caterpillar juice then fuels 
the development of the imaginal discs into eyes, antennae, legs, wings, genitalia, and other body parts. Once its new body is built, 
the insect molts one last time, shedding the pupal cuticle. From there, it’s free to fly away 
a new butterfly. Even after such a dramatic transformation, the butterfly does retain some memories 
from its caterpillar days. It’s likely the mushroom bodies 
of the brain carry important knowledge from the
caterpillar over to the adult butterfly. How did such an involved developmental 
process come to be? We don’t know for sure. The leading theory is that the caterpillar
is actually a drawn-out version of a life stage that takes place 
inside the egg for some other insects. According to this hypothesis,
over millions of years, the larvae evolved the ability
to eat and live outside the egg. Regardless of how complete 
metamorphosis originated, it’s become part of the life cycles of
a dizzying number of insect species. Still, plenty of species get along 
perfectly well with a simpler developmental process. What survival advantages might 
complete metamorphosis provide to make up for the added hassle? For one, it keeps larvae and adults from competing for the same habitats
and food sources. And while the pupa may seem vulnerable, this immobile stage 
can actually be a good way to pass parts of the year 
when food is scarce. To us, a butterfly’s metamorphosis 
might sound as fantastic as a phoenix rising from its ashes. But these transformations are taking place
all around us, all the time. From the Hercules beetle to the honey bee to the garden ant, countless squishy larvae dissolve 
and emerge as armored, aerodynamic, 
and nimble adults.","The video discusses the life cycle of butterflies, specifically the process of complete metamorphosis. This process involves the caterpillar's body dissolving and being rebuilt from its own juices. The caterpillar goes through four molts before its levels of juvenile hormone drop, triggering the final molting process.

10,10,bVMVxJJ7P8M,Cannibalism in the animal kingdom - Bill Schutt,"In the deserts of the American Southwest, spadefoot toad tadpoles 
hatch in tiny oases. Until they develop into toadlets, 
they can’t survive outside of water, but these ponds are transient 
and quickly evaporate. The tadpoles are 
in a race against the clock to grow up before 
their nurseries disappear. So nearly overnight,
some of the brood explode in size. They use their jack-o-lantern teeth 
and huge jaw muscles to devour their smaller pond mates. Nourished by this extra fuel, they develop quicker, 
leaving the pond before it can dry out. The spadefoot toad 
is far from the only animal to eat members of its own species 
as a normal part of its life cycle. All of these animals do. If that surprises you, 
you’re in good company. Until recently, scientists 
thought cannibalism was a rare response to starvation 
or other extreme stress. Well-known cannibals, like the praying mantis
and black widow spider, were considered bizarre exceptions. But now, we know they more 
or less represent the rule. While it may seem counterproductive for members of the same species 
to eat each other, cannibalism can promote the survival 
of the species as a whole by reducing competition, culling the weak, and bolstering the strong. Some species, like the spadefoot toad, cannibalize in response 
to environmental pressures. Their situation is precarious, but cannibalism for them isn’t 
a last-ditch attempt to avoid starvation. Rather, it’s a way to more quickly 
outgrow a stage where they’re especially vulnerable 
to predation or dangerous environmental conditions. Other species, including many fish, indiscriminately cannibalize each other 
during foraging behavior. Fish produce large numbers of tiny young, and adults exhibit about as much 
individual recognition of their offspring as humans do for a handful of raisins. Fish eggs, larvae, and juveniles 
are easily available, nutrient-rich meals, and with thousands of eggs in a clutch, plenty are still available to hatch 
after the adults have snacked. Baby fish aren’t just at risk of being 
cannibalized by adults— siblings eat each other too. Sand tiger shark eggs develop and hatch inside their mother’s oviducts 
at different times. When the hatchlings run out of yolk 
from their own eggs, they eat the other eggs and hatchlings until one baby shark
from each oviduct remains. When they emerge, the young sharks 
are well-nourished, experienced predators who stand a better chance of surviving. Even when they aren’t consumed 
for nutrition, young animals are especially 
vulnerable to cannibalism. Hamsters, rats, and other rodent mothers will eat some of their young
if they’re sick, dead, or simply too numerous to feed. In other mammals, 
including bears and lions, males will kill offspring 
sired by another. That’s because childless females become 
receptive to mating more quickly than if they were caring for a cub. Rather than waste nutritious meat,
the males then eat the dead cubs. Meanwhile, cannibalism is less common 
in birds than in other groups, but certain species will eat diseased
or dead hatchlings as a way of disposing of the
bodies before they can attract maggots. When adults eat each other, males are
cannibalized more often than females, usually during mating 
and generally because they’re smaller. Male Australian redback spiders
mate with much larger females. Rather than scrambling away after mating, 
the tiny male does a somersault, bringing his abdomen into contact 
with his mate’s mouthparts. The female showers him with enzyme-rich 
gut juice and consumes his abdomen. Males not killed in the initial mating 
crawl back into the fray, often half-eaten, to mate again, after which they’re 
dispatched to the spider pantry. So not only does the male provide 
the female with his sperm, but he also provides her with 
a nutritious meal to better ensure that she’ll
survive to pass on his genes. All in all, it’s clear 
that cannibalism is as much a part of life 
in the animal kingdom as other, better-recognized behaviors. As we sink our teeth into the evidence 
of cannibalism in nature, we might ask ourselves, what else have we missed by applying
human standards to the natural world?","The spadefoot toad tadpoles eat their smaller pond mates to grow faster and survive in their temporary desert ponds. Cannibalism is common in the animal kingdom and helps species survive by reducing competition and promoting the strong. Other animals like fish, hamsters, rats, bears, and lions also practice cannibalism for various reasons. Males are often eaten more than females, especially during mating.

11,11,BvLolPN8NvU,A simple way to tell insects apart - Anika Hazra,"A whip-like straw. Powerful, crushing blades. A pointed, piercing tube. There are nearly a million 
known insect species in the world, but most have one of just 
five common types of mouthparts. And that’s extremely useful to scientists because when they encounter 
an unfamiliar insect in the wild, they can learn a lot about it 
just by examining how it eats. Scientific classification, or taxonomy, is used to organize all 
living things into seven levels: kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. The features of an insect’s mouthparts can
help identify which order it belongs to, while also providing clues about how 
it evolved and what it feeds on. The chewing mouthpart is the most common. It’s also the most primitive— all other mouthparts are thought to have 
started out looking like this one before evolving into something different. It features a pair 
of jaws called mandibles with toothed inner edges that cut up 
and crush solid foods, like leaves or other insects. You can find this mouthpart 
on ants from the Hymenoptera order, grasshoppers and crickets 
of the Orthoptera order, dragonflies of the Odonata order, and beetles of the Coleoptera order. The piercing-sucking mouthpart consists of
a long, tube-like structure called a beak. This beak can pierce plant 
or animal tissue to suck up liquids like sap or blood. It can also secrete saliva 
with digestive enzymes that liquefy food for easier sucking. Insects in the Hemiptera order 
have piercing-sucking mouthparts and include bed bugs, cicadas, aphids, and leafhoppers. The siphoning mouthpart, a friendlier version 
of the piercing and sucking beak, also consists of a long, tube-like 
structure called a proboscis that works like a straw 
to suck up nectar from flowers. Insects of the Lepidoptera order— butterflies and moths— keep their proboscises rolled
up tightly beneath their heads when they’re not feeding and unfurl them when 
they come across some sweet nectar. With the sponging mouthpart,
there’s yet another tube, this time ending in two spongy lobes that contain many finer 
tubes called pseudotracheae. The pseudotracheae secrete 
enzyme-filled saliva and soak up fluids 
and dissolved foods by capillary action. House flies, fruit flies, and the other non-biting 
members of the Diptera order are the only insects 
that use this technique. But, there’s a catch. Biting flies within Diptera, like mosquitoes, horse flies, and deer flies, have a piercing-sucking mouthpart 
instead of the sponging mouthpart. And finally, the chewing-lapping mouthpart
is a combination of mandibles and a proboscis with a tongue-like 
structure at its tip for lapping up nectar. On this type of mouthpart, the mandibles themselves 
are not actually used for eating. For bees and wasps,
members of the Hymenoptera order, they serve instead as tools 
for pollen-collecting and wax-molding. Of course, in nature, there are always 
exceptions to the rules. The juvenile stages of some insects, 
for example, have completely different kinds 
of mouths than their adult versions, like caterpillars, which use chewing 
mouthparts to devour leaves before metamorphosing into
butterflies and moths with siphoning mouthparts. Still, mouthpart identification can, 
for the most part, help scientists—and you
—categorize insects. So why not break out a magnifying lens and learn a little more about
who’s nibbling your vegetable garden, biting your arm, or just flying by your ear.","Did you know that there are only five common types of mouthparts found in nearly a million known insect species? Scientists use these mouthparts to identify and classify insects into seven levels of taxonomy. The five mouthparts are chewing, piercing-sucking, siphoning, sponging, and chewing-lapping. Each mouthpart has unique features that help scientists identify the insect's order, evolutionary history, and diet. For example, ants have chewing mouthparts, while butterflies have siphoning mouthparts. Next time you see an insect, take a closer look at its mouthparts and see if you can identify which order it belongs to!"
12,12,y6u1GPpJuR4,Why do animals form swarms? - Maria R. D'Orsogna,"When desert locusts are well fed,
they're solitary creatures. But when food becomes scarce, hungry, desperate locusts
crowd onto small patches of land where they can still find 
something to eat. Contact between different locusts'
hind legs set off a slew of reactions that change their appearance and behavior. Now, instead of shunning their peers,
they seek each other out. The locusts eventually start marching
and then fly away in large numbers seeking a better habitat. These gigantic swarms can host
millions of insects and travel thousands of miles, devastating vegetation and crops. They stay close to each other,
but not too close, or they might get eaten
by their hungry neighbors. When many individual organisms, like locusts, bacteria, anchovies, or bats, come together and move 
as one coordinated entity, that's a swarm. From a handful of birds 
to billions of insects, swarms can be almost any size. But what they have in common
is that there's no leader. Members of the swarm interact
only with their nearest neighbors or through indirect cues. Each individual follows simple rules: Travel in the same direction 
as those around you, stay close, and avoid collisions. There are many benefits to traveling
in a group like this. Small prey may fool predators
by assembling into a swarm that looks like a much bigger organism. And congregating in a large group reduces the chance that any single 
individual will be captured. Moving in the same direction
as your neighbors saves energy by sharing the effort
of fighting wind or water resistance. It may even be easier 
to find a mate in a swarm. Swarming can also allow groups of animals to accomplish tasks 
they couldn’t do individually. When hundreds or millions or organisms
follow the same simple rules, sophisticated behavior called
swarm intelligence may arise. A single ant can't do much on its own, but an ant colony 
can solve complex problems, like building a nest and finding the shortest path
to a food source. But sometimes, things can go wrong. In a crowd, diseases spread more easily, and some swarming organisms may start
eating each other if food is scarce. Even some of the benefits of swarms,
like more efficient navigation, can have catastrophic consequences. Army ants are one example. They lay down chemicals called pheromones which signal their neighbors 
to follow the trail. This is good if the head of the group
is marching towards a food source. But occasionally the ants in the front
can veer off course. The whole swarm can get caught
in a loop following the pheromone trail until they die of exhaustion. Humans are notoriously individualistic,
though social, animals. But is there anything we can learn
from collective swarm-based organization? When it comes to technology,
the answer is definitely yes. Bats can teach drones how to navigate
confined spaces without colliding, fish can help design software
for safer driving, and insects are inspiring robot teams that
can assist search and rescue missions. For swarms of humans, 
it's perhaps more complicated and depends on the motives and leadership. Swarm behavior in human populations can
sometimes manifest as a destructive mob. But collective action can also produce
a crowd-sourced scientific breakthrough and artistic expression, or a peaceful global revolution.","Animals form swarms for various reasons, such as finding food, avoiding predators, and conserving energy. Swarming allows individuals to follow simple rules and achieve complex tasks. Locusts, for example, change their behavior and appearance when they come into contact with other locusts, forming massive swarms that can devastate crops. Swarms can also be beneficial, such as when small prey assemble into a large group to fool predators. Swarm intelligence can arise when individuals follow the same rules, allowing them to solve complex problems. Humans can learn from swarm-based organization, especially in technology, where it can inspire safer driving software and search and rescue missions. However, swarm behavior in humans can also manifest as destructive mobs or peaceful global revolutions, depending on leadership and motives."
13,13,Hja0SLs2kus,The amazing ways plants defend themselves - Valentin Hammoudi,"This is a tomato plant, and this is an aphid slowly killing
the tomato plant by sucking the juice out of its leaves. The tomato is putting up a fight
using both physical and chemical defenses to repel the attacking insects. But that's not all. The tomato is also releasing compounds
that signal nearby tomato plants to release their own insect repellent. Plants are constantly under attack. They face threats ranging from 
microscopic fungi and bacteria, small herbivores, like aphids,
caterpillars, and grasshoppers, up to large herbivores, like tortoises,
koalas, and elephants. All are looking to devour plants
to access the plentiful nutrients and water in their leaves, stems,
fruits, and seeds. But plants are ready with a whole
series of internal and external defenses that make them a much less 
appealing meal, or even a deadly one. Plants' defenses start at their surface. The bark covering tree trunks is full
of lignin, a rigid web of compounds that's
tough to chew and highly impermeable to pathogens. Leaves are protected by
a waxy cuticle that deters insects and microbes. Some plants go a step further
with painful structures to warn would-be predators. Thorns, spines, and prickles
discourage bigger herbivores. To deal with smaller pests, some plants'
leaves have sharp hair-like structures called trichomes. The kidney bean plant sports tiny
hooks to stab the feet of bed bugs and other insects. In some species, trichomes also dispense
chemical irritants. Stinging nettles release a mixture
of histamine and other toxins that cause pain and inflammation
when touched. For other plant species, the pain comes
after an herbivore's first bite. Spinach, kiwi fruit, pineapple, fuchsia and rhubarb all produce microscopic
needle-shaped crystals called raphides. They can cause tiny wounds in the inside
of animals' mouths, which create entry points for toxins. The mimosa plant has a strategy
designed to prevent herbivores from taking a bite at all. Specialized mechanoreceptor cells
detect touch and shoot an electrical signal
through the leaflet to its base causing cells there to release
charged particles. The buildup of charge draws
water out of these cells and they shrivel, 
pulling the leaflet closed. The folding movement scares insects away and the shrunken leaves look less
appealing to larger animals. If these external defenses are breached, the plant immune system 
springs into action. Plants don't have a separate immune system
like animals. Instead, every cell has the ability
to detect and defend against invaders. Specialized receptors can recognize 
molecules that signal the presence of dangerous microbes or insects. In response, the immune system initiates 
a battery of defensive maneuvers. To prevent more pathogens from making
their way inside, the waxy cuticle thickens and cell walls
get stronger. Guard cells seal up pores in the leaves. And if microbes are devouring one section
of the plant, those cells can self-destruct 
to quarantine the infection. Compounds toxic to microbes and insects
are also produced, often tailor-made for a specific threat. Many of the plant molecules that humans
have adopted as drugs, medicines and seasonings evolved as part of plants' immune systems
because they're antimicrobial, or insecticidal. An area of a plant under attack can alert
other regions using hormones, airborne compounds, or even electrical signals. When other parts of the plant detect
these signals, they ramp up production
of defensive compounds. And for some species, like tomatoes, this early warning system also
alerts their neighbors. Some plants can even recruit
allies to adopt a strong offense against their would-be attackers. Cotton plants under siege by caterpillars release a specific cocktail of ten
to twelve chemicals into the air. This mixture attracts parasitic wasps 
that lay eggs inside the caterpillars. Plants may not be able to flee the scene
of an attack, or fight off predators with teeth
and claws, but with sturdy armor, a well-stocked chemical arsenal, a neighborhood watch, and cross-species alliances, a plant isn't always an easy meal.","Plants have various ways to defend themselves against predators, such as physical barriers, chemical repellents, and even communication with other plants. They have external defenses like bark, waxy cuticles, thorns, and trichomes, and internal defenses like specialized receptors, immune systems, and self-destruction of infected cells. Plants can also alert nearby plants of potential threats and recruit allies to attack predators.

Curious facts:

* Plants can signal nearby plants to release insect repellent.
* Some plants have sharp hair-like structures called trichomes that can stab insects.
* Stinging nettles release a mixture of histamine and other toxins that cause pain and inflammation.
* Spinach, kiwi fruit, pineapple, fuchsia, and rhubarb produce microscopic needle-shaped crystals called raphides that can cause tiny wounds in animals' mouths.
* The mimosa plant can fold its leaves to scare insects away and make itself look less appealing to larger animals.
* Plants can self-destruct infected cells to quarantine the infection.
* Many plant molecules that humans have adopted as drugs, medicines, and seasonings evolved as part of plants' immune systems.
* Cotton plants can recruit parasitic wasps to lay eggs inside caterpillars that attack them."
14,14,8RI0JnB_OaE,The ferocious predatory dinosaurs of Cretaceous Sahara - Nizar Ibrahim,"There are few places on Earth 
less hospitable to life than the bone-dry Sahara Desert. Yet it wasn't always this way. 100 million years ago, during a period
known as the Mid-Cretaceous, a gargantuan river system flowed
across the region from modern day Egypt to Morocco. The whole world at that time
would look rather different to us. The continents had yet to assume
their current positions. Extreme temperatures were common and fierce storms made life unpredictable. Dinosaurs flourished on land, pterosaurs roamed the skies, and giant marine reptiles and sharks
swam in warm seas. Small mammals, our ancestors,
lived quite literally in the shadow of these extraordinary creatures. In this world of huge predators, the River of Giants, which is what some call this region
of what is now northern Africa, stood out as particularly dangerous. In most ecosystems, it's lonely at
the top of the food chain. There usually isn't enough prey
to sustain many predators. Yet an incredible variety of aquatic
prey species in the river-based ecosystem may have allowed a large and diverse
population of apex predators to coexist. We know this thanks to a wealth of fossils
we found in an area called the Kem Kem Beds. Many of the predators we've discovered
had head and body shapes that made them uniquely adapted
to hunt the different types and sizes of aquatic prey. This allowed many Kem Kem predators to
take full advantage of the one abundant food source
in this environment: fish. This also allowed them 
to avoid direct competition with the predators going after
land-loving animals. Prey species in the river system had to
contend with attacks from all sides, including from above. Flying reptiles dominated the skies. Alanqa Saharica had a wingspan of
up to nine meters, and long slender jaws that helped it
snatch fish and small terrestrial animals. At least seven different types 
of crocodile-like predators patrolled the waterways, including the roughly 
ten-meter-long Elosuchus. And multiple species of T-rex-sized
carnivorous dinosaurs called theropods, lived side by side. In the River of Giants,
Spinosaurus was king. This 15-meter-long dinosaur was even
longer than T-rex, with short muscular hind legs, a flexible tail, and broad feet. It's two-meter-high sail warned
other creatures of its fearsome size and may have also been 
used to attract mates. Spinosaurus' long slender jaws were spiked
with conical teeth, perfect for swiftly clamping down
on slippery aquatic prey. This apex predator, 
as well as its ecosystem, is unparalleled in the history
of life on Earth. All that's left of these 
fearsome predators are fossils. About 93 million years ago, 
sea levels rose, submerging the Kem Kem region
in a shallow sea. Tens of millions of years later, an asteroid impact, volcanic eruptions, and associated changes in climate wiped out the dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and
many other groups of animals and plants, including their unique ecoysystems. That mass extinction paved the way
for the rise of new kinds of birds, larger mammals, and eventually us.","The Sahara Desert wasn't always a barren wasteland. 100 million years ago, it was a lush river system teeming with life. This ecosystem was home to a diverse array of aquatic predators, including crocodile-like creatures and massive dinosaurs like Spinosaurus, which had a 15-meter long body and a 2-meter tall sail on its back. These predators coexisted and thrived thanks to the abundance of fish in the river system. Fossils found in the Kem Kem Beds region reveal the unique adaptations of these predators and the rich biodiversity of their ecosystem."
15,15,sz3Yv3On4lE,The three different ways mammals give birth - Kate Slabosky,"What do these animals have in common? More than you might think. Along with over 5,000 other species,
they're mammals, or members of class mammalia. All mammals are vertebrates,
meaning they have backbones. But mammals are distinguished 
from other vertebrates by a number of shared features. That includes warm blood, body hair or fur, the ability to breathe using lungs, and nourishing their young with milk. But despite these similarities, these creatures also have 
many biological differences, and one of the most remarkable
is how they give birth. Let's start with the most familiar,
placental mammals. This group includes humans, cats, dogs, giraffes, and even the blue whale,
the biggest animal on Earth. Its placenta, a solid disk
of blood-rich tissue, attaches to the wall of the uterus
to support the developing embryo. The placenta is what keeps
the calf alive during pregnancy. Directly connected to 
the mother's blood supply, it funnels nutrients and oxygen 
straight into the calf's body via the umbilical cord, and also exports its waste. Placental mammals can spend far
longer inside the womb than other mammals. Baby blue whales, for instance, spend
almost a full year inside their mother. The placenta keeps the calf alive
right up until its birth, when the umbilical cord breaks and the newborn's own respiratory, circulatory, and waste disposal systems take over. Measuring about 23 feet,
a newborn calf is already able to swim. It will spend the next six months drinking 225 liters of 
its mothers thick, fatty milk per day. Meanwhile, in Australia,
you can find a second type of mammal - marsupials. Marsupial babies are so tiny and delicate
when they're born that they must continue developing
in the mother's pouch. Take the quoll, one of the world's
smallest marsupials, which weighs only 18 milligrams at birth, the equivalent of about 30 sugar grains. The kangaroo, another marsupial, gives birth to a single 
jelly bean-sized baby at a time. The baby crawls down the middle
of the mother's three vaginas, then must climb up to the pouch, where she spends 
the next 6-11 months suckling. Even after the baby kangaroo leaves
this warm haven, she'll return to suckle milk. Sometimes, she's just one of three babies
her mother is caring for. A female kangaroo can often simultaneously
support one inside her uterus and another in her pouch. In unfavorable conditions, female kangaroos can pause
their pregnancies. When that happens, she's able
to produce two different kinds of milk, one for her newborn, and one for her older joey. The word mammalia means of the breast, which is a bit of a misnomer because while kangaroos do produce
milk from nipples in their pouches, they don't actually have breasts. Nor do monotremes, the third and arguably
strangest example of mammalian birth. There were once hundreds 
of monotreme species, but there are only five left: four species of echidnas
and the duck-billed platypus. The name monotreme means one hole referring to the single orifice they use
for reproduction, excretion, and egg-laying. Like birds, reptiles, fish, dinosaurs, and others, these species lay eggs instead
of giving birth to live young. Their eggs are soft-shelled, and when their babies hatch, they suckle
milk from pores on their mother's body until they're large enough 
to feed themselves. Despite laying eggs and other adaptations
that we associate more with non-mammals, like the duck-bill platypus's webbed feet, bill, and the venomous spur 
males have on their feet, they are, in fact, mammals. That's because they share the defining
characteristics of mammalia and are evolutionarily linked
to the rest of the class. Whether placental, marsupial, or monotreme, each of these creatures and its unique
birthing methods, however bizarre, have succeeded for many millennia
in bringing new life and diversity into the mammal kingdom.","Mammals have many biological differences, including how they give birth. Placental mammals, like humans and giraffes, have a placenta that nourishes the developing embryo. Marsupials, like kangaroos, give birth to tiny babies that continue developing in the mother's pouch. Monotremes, like the duck-billed platypus, lay eggs and feed their babies milk from pores on their body. Despite these differences, all mammals share defining characteristics and have evolved unique birthing methods that have succeeded for millions of years.

Curious facts:

* Baby blue whales spend almost a full year inside their mother.
* The umbilical cord breaks when the newborn calf is ready to breathe on its own.
* Marsupial babies are so tiny and delicate when they're born that they must continue developing in the mother's pouch.
* A female kangaroo can simultaneously support one baby inside her uterus and another in her pouch.
* Kangaroos can pause their pregnancies in unfavorable conditions.
* Monotremes lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young.
* The duck-billed platypus has webbed feet, a bill, and the venomous spur on its feet."
