      "The video discusses the evolution of turtle shells, which have two separate shells that develop independently while the turtle is still an embryo. The upper shell, or carapace, is made of 50 bones that form from a bulge of cells called the carapacial ridge. The lower shell, or plastron, is made of nine plate-like bones that are produced by neural crest cells. The shell provides protection for turtles, but also presents challenges for breathing. The video also mentions that the first known turtle ancestor, Eunotosaurus africanus, had broad, flat ribs that anchored the muscles of its powerful forearms.\n",
