0,W9wAfqBd_T0,How turtle shells evolved... twice - Judy Cebra Thomas,"Meet Odontochelys semitestacea. This little creature spends its days 
splashing in Late Triassic swamps with a host of other reptiles. Under the surface lies its best 
defense against attack: a hard shell on its belly. Odontochelys is an early ancestor 
of the turtle. Its half-shelled body illustrates an 
important point about the modern turtle: it actually has two shells that develop 
totally separately while the turtle is still an embryo. Both are extensions of the animal’s 
skeleton, and together they are made 
of almost 60 bones. Like other embryos, turtle embryos are made of 
undifferentiated cells that become specific cell types, and then organs and tissues, through gene activity and communication
between cells. At first, turtle embryos look very similar
to those of other reptiles, birds, and mammals, except for a bulge of cells called 
the carapacial ridge. The ridge expands around the body 
between the neck and lower back, creating a disc shape. It guides the formation of the upper part
of the turtle’s shell, called the carapace, likely by attracting 
the cells that will become ribs. Instead of curving downwards 
to make a regular rib cage, the ribs move outwards towards the 
carapacial ridge. They then secrete a signaling protein that converts surrounding cells 
into bone-forming cells. These fifty bones grow until they meet 
and connect with sutures. A ring of bone solidifies 
the carapace’s edges. The outer layer of skin cells produces 
the scales, known as scutes, that cover the carapace. The development of the bottom half 
of the shell, the plastron, is driven by neural crest cells, which can produce a variety of different 
cell types including neurons, cartilage and bone. A thick shield of these cells 
spreads across the belly, coming together in regions that produce
nine plate-like bones. Eventually, these connect to the 
carapace by sutures. A turtle’s shell has obvious advantages
for guarding against predators, but the rigid casing also presents 
some challenges. As the turtle grows, the sutures between the bones 
of the carapace and plastron spread. Most mammals and reptiles rely on a
flexible rib cage that expands to allow them to breathe, but turtles use abdominal muscles 
attached to the shell instead: one to breathe in, 
and one to breathe out. So how did the shell evolve? Though there are still gaps in the 
fossil record, the first step seems to have been 
a thickening of the ribs. The oldest known turtle ancestor, a creature called Eunotosaurus africanus, lived 260 million years ago and looked 
almost nothing like a modern turtle, but it had a set of broad, flat ribs that anchored the muscles 
of its powerful forearms. Eunotosaurus was likely 
a burrowing creature, digging homes for itself in what’s 
now southern Africa. Odontochelys semitestacea illustrates 
another, later step in turtle evolution, with thick ribs like Eunotosaurus 
plus a belly plate for protection. Our first fossil evidence of the full 
shell characteristic of modern turtles is about 210 million years old, and belongs to a species called 
Proganochelys quenstedti, whose ribs had fused. Proganochelys could move 
between water and land. Unlike modern turtles, it couldn’t retract
its head into its shell, but had defensive spines on its neck. Modern turtle shells are almost as diverse
as the turtles themselves. Sea turtles have flatter, lighter shells 
for streamlined gliding through the water. Land-dwelling tortoises, meanwhile, have domed shells that can slip free of
predators’ jaws and help them turn right-side up if 
they fall on their backs. Leatherback and softshell turtles have shells without the ring of bone 
around the edge of the carapace or the tough scutes covering it, making it easier for them to 
squeeze into tight spaces."
1,Cd-artSbpXc,Why are fish fish-shaped? - Lauren Sallan,"In tropical seas, flying fish leap out of the water, gliding for up to 200 meters 
using wing-like fins, before dipping back into the sea. In the Indo-Pacific, a hunting sailfish can reach speeds 
of 110 kilometers per hour. That’s 11 times faster than Olympic 
swimming champion Michael Phelps. It can then stick up its spiny dorsal fin 
like a brake, grinding to a dead halt, mid-swim. Each of these physical feats is made 
possible by a fish’s form, which in most species is a smooth, 
elongated body, fins, and a tail. These features are shared across thousands
of fish species, each introducing its own variations on
the theme to survive in unique habitats. What makes these features so
commonplace in fish, and what does it reveal about the more 
than 33,000 fish species that inhabit earth’s rivers, 
lakes, and seas? Fish can be split into two main groups, according to the type 
of motion they favor. The first is body 
and caudal fin driven motion, and most fish species, about 85%, 
fall into this group. Here, the body and tail 
are the primary propelling forces, with fins mainly playing 
a stabilizing and steering role. This configuration suits 
many open-water species, which need speed, thrust and control for
constant, efficient swimming. Eels lie at one extreme of this group. Known as anguilliform swimmers, their entire bodies undulate to generate 
a wave-like motion. Compared to anguilliform fish, species like salmon and trout, 
known as subcarangiforms, use about two-thirds of their body mass
to generate motion, while carangiform swimmers, 
such as mackerel, only use about a third. Typically, the less of its mass a fish 
uses to generate motion, the more streamlined its shape. At the other end of the spectrum from eels
are ostraciiform species like boxfish, and thunniform swimmers like tuna. In these fish, the tails, 
also known as caudal fins, do the work. A tuna’s tail is attached by tendons 
to multiple muscles in its body. It powers the body like an engine, forcefully catapulting
the bullet-like fish to speeds up to 69 kilometers per hour. The second major fish group relies 
on median and paired fin motion, meaning they’re propelled through the 
water predominantly by their fins. Fins allow fine-tuned movement 
at slow speeds, so this propulsion 
is typically found in fish that have to navigate complex habitats. Bottom-dwelling fishes, like rays,
fall into this group; using their huge pectoral fins, they can
lift themselves swiftly off the sea floor. That conveniently allows them 
to inhabit shallow seas without being buffeted about by waves. Similarly, shallow-water flatfish 
use their entire bodies as one big fin to hoist 
themselves up off the sand. Ocean sunfish lack tails, so they move around slowly by beating 
their wing-like median fins instead. Similar movements are shared 
by many reef species, like the queen angelfish, surgeonfish, and wrasse. Their focus on fins has taken 
the demand off their bodies, many of which have consequently 
evolved into unusual and inventive shapes. There are fishes within both groups 
that seem to be outliers. But if you look closer, you’ll notice that these 
common traits are disguised. Seahorses, for instance, don’t appear 
fish-shaped in any conventional way, yet they use their flexible 
dorsal fins as makeshift tails. A pufferfish may occasionally 
look more like a lethal balloon, but if it needs to swim rapidly,
it’ll retract its spines. Handfish look like they have legs, but really these limb-like 
structures are fins, modified to help them 
amble across the sea floor. For fish, motion underpins survival, so it’s become a huge evolutionary 
driver of form. The widespread features of fish 
have been maintained across tens of thousands of fish species, not to mention other 
ocean-dwelling animals, like penguins, dolphins, sea slugs, and squids. And that’s precisely because 
they’ve proven so successful."
2,_hBAr7uJ6L8,The surprising reasons animals play dead - Tierney Thys,"Imagine you’re being attacked 
by a ferocious predator. With no chance of escape, you do what any courageous, 
self-respecting possum would do: curl into an immobile 
state called catatonia, stick out your tongue, drool, and ooze some foul-smelling 
liquid from your anal glands. Disgusted, your assailant 
loosens its grip, decides you’re not the dinner 
it was looking for, and departs. After 10 minutes, 
you resurrect and merrily saunter on. From lemurs to lizards, ants to amphibians, sharks to chickens, hundreds of animals
""play dead"" as a survival tactic. Nicknamed ""playing possum"" 
after its star performer, feigning death is also called thanatosis. That’s from Thanatos, 
the ancient Greek deity of death. But most scientists call it 
tonic immobility, or TI. How and why TI occurs depends 
on the species and situation. Spewing stench and adopting odd postures
are common and often play important roles. Other animals sacrifice their neighbors: quail chicks that freeze 
while their kin run amok have a better chance of survival 
when pursued by a cat. Speaking of cats, feline mothers can pinch
the napes of their kittens’ necks and induce another kind of 
immobility called clipnosis. This keeps their kittens quiet 
and easy to transport. Most of the physiological mechanisms 
underlying these theatrics originate in 
the parasympathetic nervous system, better known for controlling cycles 
of resting and digesting. In possums, the parasympathetic nervous system causes
their heart rates to drop by nearly half, respiration by a third, and body temperatures by more than half a
degree Celsius for up to an hour. The neurotransmitter dopamine 
also plays a part. Flour beetles with low dopamine levels 
play dead more frequently than those with high levels, and anything blocking dopamine receptor 
sites can lengthen catatonia. But maintaining a death ruse isn’t easy. The performers are constantly 
gauging their surroundings for cues on when it’s safe to rise. Chickens, for instance, can sense
when a predator’s eyes are upon them. Researchers know this because when they
used a stuffed hawk in an experiment, their chicken subjects came out of their
catatonia quicker when the hawk’s eyes were averted. Other animals use TI for purposes 
other than defense. When the sleeper cichlid feels peckish, it sinks to the lake floor 
and lies motionless, its splotchy coloration making it 
seem like a rotting carcass. If a small scavenger investigates, 
this undead trickster strikes. Some animals even feign death 
as a sexual ploy. Male nursery spiders offer gifts of
silk-wrapped insects in hopes of wooing females. But those females are known 
to eat love-seeking males. By playing dead while the female 
eagerly devours her snack, these males can cautiously revive and improve their chances 
of successfully mating. So TI can work to an animal’s advantage,
unless someone else knows its secret. California orcas can flip over 
young great white sharks, inducing TI for so long 
the immobilized sharks, who must move to respire, 
essentially suffocate. Humans can also flip sharks into TI. By stroking a shark’s 
electrically-sensitive snout and gently turning it over, researchers can induce TI 
that lasts up to 15 minutes. That’s enough time to insert tags, remove hooks, and even perform surgeries. There are risks however: TI can hamper respiration and induce
hyperglycemia, a sign of stress. So this technique should only 
be used when necessary. Humans can also experience TI when they
freeze with fear during violent assaults. Recognizing this ancient, involuntary
form of self-defense has significant implications 
when trying to understand why some victims don’t flee 
or fight in the face of danger. So, studying TI in non-human animals not only helps us better understand some
odd behaviors, it can also help us better 
understand our own, sometimes counterintuitive, responses to violence."
3,uSTNyHkde08,Why isn't the world covered in poop? - Eleanor Slade and Paul Manning,"Somewhere near you, 
an animal is defecating. In fact, each day, the animal kingdom 
produces roughly enough dung to match the volume of water pouring 
over the Victoria Falls. So why isn’t the planet covered 
in the stuff? You can thank the humble dung beetle 
for eating up the excess. Capable of burying 250 times 
their body weight in a single night, these valiant insects make
quick work of an endless stream of feces. Over 7,000 known species of dung beetle 
run clean-up duty across six continents —everywhere except Antarctica. A dung beetle’s first task 
is to locate dung. Some live on the anal regions 
of larger animals, ready to leap off when they defecate. Others sniff out feces 
that animals leave behind. A pile of elephant dung can attract 
4,000 beetles in 15 minutes. So once a beetle finds dung, it must work quickly to secure 
some of the bounty for itself. Most dung beetle species fall into one 
of three main groups: rollers, tunnelers, and dwellers. Dung rollers sculpt a ball of dung,
and using their back legs, quickly roll it away from competitors. Potential partners jump on the ball, and once the ball-maker 
has selected their mate, the pair dig their dung ball 
into the soil. Once it’s been buried, the female lays 
a single egg within the dung ball. Tunnelers have a different approach. Digging underneath a pat, 
some drag dung down into the soil and pack it into clumps 
known as brood balls, dung balls, or dung “sausages,” 
depending on their shape and size. Male tunnelers sport a spectacular 
array of horns to fight each other
for control of these tunnels, which they then defend 
until the female’s laid her egg. Some male tunnelers avoid the fray
by masquerading as hornless females and sneaking into tunnels to mate 
while the guardians’ heads are turned. The third group of dung beetles, dwellers, take the most straightforward approach, laying their eggs
directly into a dung pat. This makes their offspring
more vulnerable to predation than those of the tunnelers and rollers. As the larvae feed, they riddle 
the dung pat with tunnels, leaving remains that are quickly colonized
by bacteria and fungi and weathered away. Inside a tunnel, ball, or pat, 
once the larvae hatch, they consume the dung 
before metamorphosing into a pupa and then an adult beetle. Besides clearing dung, 
the actions of these beetles have considerable ecological importance. For one, they serve as secondary 
seed dispersers. Dung from monkeys, wild pigs, and other animals is riddled with seeds 
from the fruits they eat. When beetles bury their dung balls, they inadvertently protect these seeds 
from predators and increase the likelihood 
they’ll germinate. The advantage is so great 
that one South African plant has evolved to produce seeds that look 
and smell like dung to trick beetles into burying them. Dung beetles also play important roles 
in agricultural systems. Livestock, like cows and sheep,
produce huge amounts of dung, which contains nutrients 
that can benefit plants. The beetles break up the dung 
and tunnel it deep into the soil, bringing the nutrients into close contact
with plant roots. Their services to farmers have been valued
at $380 million a year in the US and £367 million a year in the UK. Dung beetles can even help us battle 
global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions
associated with farming. Microbes living in oxygen-poor 
livestock dung produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas. But beetles oxygenate pats when 
they tunnel into them, preventing the microbes
from producing methane. The dung beetle spreads seeds, helps farmers, and fights climate change —and accomplishes it all
simply by doing its business. Maybe next time you come across 
some dung in the forest or a field, you’ll be tempted to take a closer look."
4,-64U7WoBrqM,Why are sloths so slow? - Kenny Coogan,"In 1796, Thomas Jefferson received
a box of bones he couldn't identify. A long, sharp claw reminded him of a lion, but the arm bones 
suggested a larger animal, one about three meters long. Thinking it might be huge unknown
species of North American lion, Jefferson warned explorers Lewis and Clark to keep an eye out 
for this mysterious predator. But Jefferson's box of bones didn't
come from a lion. They came from an extinct giant sloth. Prehistoric ground sloths first appeared
around 35 million years ago. Dozens of species lived across
North, Central and South America, alongside other ancient creatures
like mastodons and giant armadillos. Some ground sloths, like the megalonychid,
were cat-sized, but many were massive. Jefferson's sloth, Megalonyx,
weighed about a ton, and that was small 
compared to megatherium, which could reach six metric tons,
as much as an elephant. They ambled through the forests
and savannas using their strong arms and sharp claws to uproot plants and climb trees, grazing on grasses, leaves,
and prehistoric avocados. In fact, we might not have avocados
today if not for the giant sloths. Smaller animals couldn't swallow
the avocado's huge seed, but the sloths could, and they spread avocado trees
far and wide. Ground sloths flourished for millions
of years, but around 10,000 years ago,
they started disappearing along with the Western Hemisphere's
other giant mammals. Researchers think that ground sloths
could have been pushed out by an oncoming ice age, or competition with other species,
maybe humans, who arrived in the region around the time
most of the sloths went extinct. Some of the smaller sloths did survive
and migrated to the treetops. Today, there are six species left
living in the rainforest canopies of Central and South America. Hanging out in the trees is a good way
to avoid predators, and there are plenty of leaves to eat. But this diet has its drawbacks. Animals extract energy from food
and use that energy to move around, maintain their body temperature, keep their organs working, and all the other activities necessary
for survival. But leaves don't contain much energy, and that which they do have
is tough to extract. Most herbivores supplement a leafy diet
with higher energy foods like fruit and seeds. But sloths, especially three-toed sloths,
rely on leaves almost exclusively. They've evolved finely tuned strategies
for coping with this restricted diet. First, they extract as much energy from
their food as possible. Sloths have a multi-chambered stomach
that takes up a third of their body, and depending on the species, they can spend five to seven days,
or even weeks, processing a meal. The other piece of the puzzle
is to use as little energy as possible. One way sloths do this is, of course,
by not moving very much. They spend most of their time eating,
resting, or sleeping. They descend from the canopy just once
a week for a bathroom break. When sloths do move, it's not very fast. It would take a sloth about five minutes
to cross an average neighborhood street. This unhurried approach to life means
that sloths don't need very much muscle. In fact, they have about 30% less
muscle mass than other animals their size. Sloths also use less energy 
to keep themselves warm because their body temperature
can fluctuate by about five degrees Celsius, less than a cold-blooded reptile,
but more than most mammals. These physical and behavioral adaptations 
minimize the sloth's energy expenditure, or metabolic rate. Three-toed sloths have the slowest 
metabolism of any mammal. The giant panda is second slowest, and two-toed sloths come in third. Moving slowly has allowed sloths
to thrive in their treetop habitat. But it's also made the sloths themselves
a great habitat for other organisms, including algae, which provides a little
extra camouflage, and maybe even a snack. Sloths may not be giant anymore, but that doesn't make 
them any less remarkable."
5,vcPJkz-D5II,The evolution of animal genitalia - Menno Schilthuizen,"The evolutionary tango 
of animal genitalia. Can you guess what you're looking at? If you answered ""duck vagina,""
you'd be right. Although the bird's outward appearance
may not strike you as especially odd, it uses this strange, intricate, cork-screw shaped contraption 
to reproduce. We see similarly unbelievable genitalia
in insects, mammals, reptiles, fish, spiders, and even snails. Apparently, no organs evolve
faster and into more variable shapes than those involved in procreation. Superficially, it makes sense
because evolution works via reproduction. When an animal leaves more offspring,
its genes will spread. And since genitalia are an animal's tools
for reproduction, any improvement there 
will have immediate effect. And yet, what's the point of having
such decorative nether regions? After all, the function 
of genitalia seems simple. A penis deposits a bit of sperm and a vagina receives it 
and delivers it to the egg. A pipette-like thingy on the male and a funnel-like gizmo on the female
should do just fine for any animal. And yet, that's not what we see. The penis of a chicken flea, for example,
looks nothing like a pipette, more like an exploded grandfather clock. And the vagina of a featherwing beetle resembles something you'd find
in a Dr. Seuss book. Throughout the animal kingdom, genitalia are very complex things, much more complicated than seems
necessary for what they're meant to do. That's because genitalia do more than just
deposit and receive sperm. Many male animals also use the penis
as courtship device, like crane flies. In some South American species, males have a tiny washboard and scraper
on their penis, which produces a song that reverberates
throughout the female's body when they mate. It's thought that if female crane flies
enjoy this unusual serenade, they'll allow the male 
to father their offspring. This way, the genes of the most
musical penises spread, leading to rapid evolution
of insects' phalluses. Similarly, some beetles have two little
drumsticks on either side of the penis. During mating, they'll rub, slap, or tap
the female with these. And some hoofed mammals,
like rams and bulls, use a whip-like extension 
on the penis's left side to create a sensation during mating. But how can females really choose
between males if she can only assess them after mating? This is where the power
of female adaptation comes into play. In fact, insemination is different
to conception, and the female genitalia exploit
this distinction. For instance, in some dung flies, the vagina contains pockets
for separating sperm from different males depending on how appealing they were. Males using their penises for courtship and females controlling 
their own sperm management are two reasons why genitalia evolve
into such complex shapes. But there are others because genitalia are also where
a sexual conflict is played out. A female's interests are best served if
she fertilizes her eggs with the sperm of the best fathers and creates genetic variability amongst
her offspring. For a male, on the other hand,
this is bad news. For him, it would be best if a female
used his sperm to fertilize all of her eggs. So we see cycles of adaptation
in an evolutionary arms race to retain control. Black widow spiders 
have a disposable penis tip that breaks off inside the vagina
blocking the attempts of his rivals, and bed bug males bypass a female's
genitalia altogether using a syringe-like penis to inject
sperm cells directly into her belly. Not to be outdone, females have evolved 
their own countermeasures. In some bed bug species, the females have evolved an entirely
new set of genitalia on their right hand flanks
where the males usually pierce them. That allows them to maintain
the power to filter out unwanted sperm with their genitalia. And duck vaginas are shaped
like a clockwise spiral so that when the male inflates his long,
counterclockwise coiled penis into her, and she disapproves, all she needs to do 
is flex her vaginal muscles and the penis just flubs out. So, genitalia differs so much,
not just to fascinate us, but because in every species, they're the result of 
a furious evolutionary tango of sex that has been going on
for millions of years and will continue for millions 
of years to come."
6,IxndOd3kmSs,"Meet the tardigrade, the toughest animal on Earth - Thomas Boothby","Without water, a human can only
survive for about 100 hours. But there's a creature so resilient
that it can go without it for decades. This one millimeter animal can survive
both the hottest and coldest environments on Earth, and can even withstand high levels
of radiation. This is the tardigrade, and it's one of the toughest creatures
on Earth, even if it does look more like
a chubby, eight-legged gummy bear. Most organisms need water to survive. Water allows metabolism to occur, which is the process that drives
all the biochemical reactions that take place in cells. But creatures like the tardigrade,
also known as the water bear, get around this restriction
with a process called anhydrobiosis, from the Greek meaning
life without water. And however extraordinary,
tardigrades aren't alone. Bacteria, single-celled organisms called archaea, plants, and even other animals 
can all survive drying up. For many tardigrades, this requires that they go through 
something called a tun state. They curl up into a ball, pulling their head and eight legs
inside their body and wait until water returns. It's thought that as water
becomes scarce and tardigrades enter their tun state, they start synthesize special molecules, which fill the tardigrade's cells
to replace lost water by forming a matrix. Components of the cells that are
sensitive to dryness, like DNA, proteins, and membranes, get trapped in this matrix. It's thought that this keeps these
molecules locked in position to stop them from unfolding, breaking apart, or fusing together. Once the organism is rehydrated,
the matrix dissolves, leaving behind undamaged, 
functional cells. Beyond dryness, tardigrades can also
tolerate other extreme stresses: being frozen, heated up past the boiling point
of water, high levels of radiation, and even the vacuum of outer space. This has led to some erroneous speculation that tardigrades 
are extraterrestrial beings. While that's fun to think about, scientific evidence places their
origin firmly on Earth where they've evolved over time. In fact, this earthly evolution 
has given rise to over 1100 known species of tardigrades and there are probably many others
yet to be discovered. And because tardigrades are so hardy,
they exist just about everywhere. They live on every continent,
including Antarctica. And they're in diverse biomes
including deserts, ice sheets, the sea, fresh water, rainforests, and the highest mountain peaks. But you can find tardigrades
in the most ordinary places, too, like moss or lichen found in yards, parks, and forests. All you need to find them is a little
patience and a microscope. Scientists are now to trying to find out
whether tardigrades use the tun state, their anti-drying technique, to survive other stresses. If we can understand how they,
and other creatures, stabilize their sensitive 
biological molecules, perhaps we could apply this knowledge
to help us stabilize vaccines, or to develop stress-tolerant crops that 
can cope with Earth's changing climate. And by studying how tardigrades survive prolonged exposure 
to the vacuum of outer space, scientists can generate clues about
the environmental limits of life and how to safeguard astronauts. In the process, tardigrades could even
help us answer a critical question: could life survive on planets much
less hospitable than our own?"
7,VgEbcQxFUu8,Why do we harvest horseshoe crab blood? - Elizabeth Cox,"During the warmer months,
especially at night during the full moon, horseshoe crabs emerge 
from the sea to spawn. Waiting for them are teams
of lab workers who capture the horseshoe crabs
by the hundreds of thousands, take them to labs, harvest their cerulean blood, then return them to the sea. Oddly enough, we capture horseshoe crabs
on the beach because that's the only place
we know we can find them. A female horseshoe crab lays as many
as 20 batches of up to 4,000 eggs on her annual visit to the beach. When the eggs hatch, the juvenile horseshoe crabs
often stay near shore, periodically shedding their shells
as they grow. Once they leave 
these shallow waters, they don't return until they
reach sexual maturity ten years later. Despite our best efforts, we don't
know where they spend those years. Though we've spotted the occasional 
horseshoe crab as deep as 200 meters below
the ocean's surface, we only see large groups of adults
when they come ashore to spawn. Horseshoe crab blood contains
cells called amebocytes that protect them 
from infection by viruses, fungi, and bacteria. Amebocytes form gels around
these invaders to prevent them from spreading infections. This isn't unusual. All animals have protective 
immune systems. But horseshoe crab amebocytes
are exceptionally sensitive to bacterial endotoxins. Endotoxins are molecules
from the cell walls of certain bacteria, including E. coli. Large amounts of them are released
when bacterial cells die, and they can make us sick
if they enter the blood stream. Many of the medicines and medical devices
we rely on can become contaminated, so we have to test them
before they touch our blood. We do have tests called Gram stains
that detect bacteria, but they can't recognize endotoxins which can be there even when
bacteria aren't present. So scientists use an extract called LAL produced from harvested 
horseshoe crab blood to test for endotoxins. They add LAL to a medicine sample,
and if gels form, bacterial endotoxins are present. Today, the LAL test is used so widely that millions of people who've
never seen a horseshoe crab have been protected by their blood. If you've ever had an injection,
that probably includes you. How did horseshoe crabs end up
with such special blood? Like other invertebrates, the horseshoe crab has an open
circulatory system. This means their blood isn't contained
in blood vessels, like ours. Instead, horseshoe crab blood
flows freely through the body cavity and comes in direct contact with tissues. If bacteria enters their blood,
it can quickly spread over a large area. Pair this vulnerability with the horseshoe crab's bacteria-filled 
ocean and shoreline habitats, and it's easy to see why they need
such a sensitive immune response. Horseshoe crabs survived 
mass extinction events that wiped out over 90% of life on Earth
and killed off the dinosaurs, but they're not invincible. And the biggest disruptions they've faced
in millions of years come from us. Studies have shown that up to
15% of horseshoe crabs die in the process of having
their blood harvested. And recent research suggests
this number may be even higher. Researchers have also observed
fewer females returning to spawn at some of the most harvested areas. Our impact on horseshoe crabs extends
beyond the biomedical industry, too. Coastal development 
destroys spawning sites, and horseshoe crabs are also
killed for fishing bait. There's ample evidence that
their populations are shrinking. Some researchers have started working to synthesize horseshoe crab 
blood in the lab. For now, we're unlikely to stop
our beach trips, but hopefully, a synthetic alternative
will someday eliminate our reliance on the blood of these ancient creatures."
8,r5_ZSnFDPRg,The surprising reason birds sing - Partha P. Mitra,"This is a song sung by a brown thrasher. But that’s just one of the thousand 
or more that it knows, and it’s not the only avian virtuoso. A wood thrush can sing 
two pitches at once. A mockingbird can match the sounds 
around it, including car alarms. And the Australian superb lyrebird has an incredible, elaborate song 
and dance ritual. These are just a few of 
the 4,000 species of songbirds. Most birds produce short, simple calls, but songbirds also have 
a repertoire of complex vocal patterns that help them attract mates, defend territory, and strengthen their social bonds. Each songbird species 
has its own distinct song patterns, some with characteristic 
regional dialects. Experienced listeners can even distinguish
individual birds by their unique songs. So how do birds learn these songs 
in the first place? How do they know to mimic the songs 
of their own species? Are they born knowing how to sing? A lot of what scientists know about bird
song comes from studying zebra finches. A baby male zebra finch typically learns 
to sing from its father or other males, starting while it’s still 
a fledgling in the nest. First comes a sensory learning phase, when the baby finch hears the songs
sung around it and commits them to memory. The bird starts to vocalize 
during the motor learning phase, practicing until it can 
match the song it memorized. As the bird learns, hearing 
the tutor’s song over and over again is helpful—
up to a point. If he hears it too many times, the
imitation degrades— and the source matters. If the song is played 
through a loudspeaker, he can’t pick it up as easily. But hide the same loudspeaker inside 
a toy painted to look like a zebra finch, and his learning improves. What if the baby never hears another 
zebra finch’s song? Interestingly enough, it’ll sing anyway. Isolated finches still produce 
what are called innate or isolate songs. A specific tune might be taught, but the instinct to sing seems
to be hardwired into a songbird’s brain. Innate songs sound different from
the “cultured” songs learned from other finches—at first. If isolated zebra finches 
start a new colony, the young birds pick up 
the isolate song from their parents. But the song changes 
from generation to generation. And after a few iterations, the melody actually starts to resemble the cultured songs sung 
by zebra finches in the wild. Something about the learning process 
must be hardwired, too, drawing the birds towards the
same song patterns again and again. This means that basic information 
about the zebra finch song must be stored somewhere 
in its genome, imprinted there by millions 
of years of evolution. At first, this might seem odd, as we usually think of genetic code as a
source of biochemical or physical traits, not something like a behavior or action. But the two aren’t 
fundamentally different; we can connect genomes to
behavior through brain circuitry. The connection is noisy and quite complex. It doesn’t simply map single genes 
to single behaviors, but it exists. Genomes contain codes for proteins 
that guide brain development, such as molecules that guide the pathways
of developing axons, shaping distinct circuits. Birds’ brains 
have so-called “song circuits” that are active when the birds sing. These circuits also respond to the song 
of a bird’s own species more strongly than
to other species’ songs. So the theory is that a bird’s genes 
guide development of brain circuits that relate to singing 
and the ability to learn songs. Then, exposure to songs 
shapes those neural circuits to produce the songs 
that are typical to that species. Genetically encoded or innate behaviors 
aren’t unique to songbirds. They’re widespread in the animal kingdom. Spectacular examples include the long-distance migrations 
of monarch butterflies and salmon. So what does this mean for humans? Are we also born with innate 
information written into our genomes that helps shape our neural circuits, and ultimately results 
in something we know? Could there be some knowledge that is unique 
and intrinsic to humans as a species?"
9,rcAN4rkTmNU,The life cycle of the butterfly - Franziska Bauer,"In order to become a butterfly, a caterpillar’s body dissolves 
almost completely and is rebuilt from its own juices. As inconvenient and even downright 
dangerous as this process sounds, it’s actually quite common. Butterflies are just a few of 
the 800,000 insect species that transition from larvae to adults 
through complete metamorphosis. That’s approximately 85% of insects 
and 70% of all known animal species. But how exactly does 
a caterpillar become a butterfly? When a caterpillar hatches 
from an egg, it has none of a butterfly’s 
physical traits. It does have groups of cells
inside its body called imaginal discs that will eventually 
become its butterfly parts. For now, these cells remain dormant. Juvenile hormone suppresses 
their activity, and prevents the caterpillar
from beginning metamorphosis too early. Immediately after hatching,
the caterpillar begins to feed, building up fat until its rigid skin,
called a cuticle, becomes too tight. At this point, a hormone called ecdysone 
triggers the cuticle to shed, or molt. As the caterpillar grows, 
it usually molts four times. Then, when it’s nice and plump, the caterpillar’s levels 
of juvenile hormone drop, which triggers it to stop
eating and moving. A final burst of ecdysone prompts the caterpillar’s cells 
to begin to self-destruct. Soon, the muscles, fat, and other tissues 
are almost entirely liquefied, though the imaginal discs stay intact
and begin to grow. At the same time, a second skin layer 
called the pupal cuticle forms underneath the first. One more molt exposes 
the hard exterior of the pupa. Besides the imaginal discs, 
only a few tissues are spared, including parts of the respiratory system, the heart, some abdominal muscles, and the mushroom bodies of the brain. The caterpillar juice then fuels 
the development of the imaginal discs into eyes, antennae, legs, wings, genitalia, and other body parts. Once its new body is built, 
the insect molts one last time, shedding the pupal cuticle. From there, it’s free to fly away 
a new butterfly. Even after such a dramatic transformation, the butterfly does retain some memories 
from its caterpillar days. It’s likely the mushroom bodies 
of the brain carry important knowledge from the
caterpillar over to the adult butterfly. How did such an involved developmental 
process come to be? We don’t know for sure. The leading theory is that the caterpillar
is actually a drawn-out version of a life stage that takes place 
inside the egg for some other insects. According to this hypothesis,
over millions of years, the larvae evolved the ability
to eat and live outside the egg. Regardless of how complete 
metamorphosis originated, it’s become part of the life cycles of
a dizzying number of insect species. Still, plenty of species get along 
perfectly well with a simpler developmental process. What survival advantages might 
complete metamorphosis provide to make up for the added hassle? For one, it keeps larvae and adults from competing for the same habitats
and food sources. And while the pupa may seem vulnerable, this immobile stage 
can actually be a good way to pass parts of the year 
when food is scarce. To us, a butterfly’s metamorphosis 
might sound as fantastic as a phoenix rising from its ashes. But these transformations are taking place
all around us, all the time. From the Hercules beetle to the honey bee to the garden ant, countless squishy larvae dissolve 
and emerge as armored, aerodynamic, 
and nimble adults."
10,bVMVxJJ7P8M,Cannibalism in the animal kingdom - Bill Schutt,"In the deserts of the American Southwest, spadefoot toad tadpoles 
hatch in tiny oases. Until they develop into toadlets, 
they can’t survive outside of water, but these ponds are transient 
and quickly evaporate. The tadpoles are 
in a race against the clock to grow up before 
their nurseries disappear. So nearly overnight,
some of the brood explode in size. They use their jack-o-lantern teeth 
and huge jaw muscles to devour their smaller pond mates. Nourished by this extra fuel, they develop quicker, 
leaving the pond before it can dry out. The spadefoot toad 
is far from the only animal to eat members of its own species 
as a normal part of its life cycle. All of these animals do. If that surprises you, 
you’re in good company. Until recently, scientists 
thought cannibalism was a rare response to starvation 
or other extreme stress. Well-known cannibals, like the praying mantis
and black widow spider, were considered bizarre exceptions. But now, we know they more 
or less represent the rule. While it may seem counterproductive for members of the same species 
to eat each other, cannibalism can promote the survival 
of the species as a whole by reducing competition, culling the weak, and bolstering the strong. Some species, like the spadefoot toad, cannibalize in response 
to environmental pressures. Their situation is precarious, but cannibalism for them isn’t 
a last-ditch attempt to avoid starvation. Rather, it’s a way to more quickly 
outgrow a stage where they’re especially vulnerable 
to predation or dangerous environmental conditions. Other species, including many fish, indiscriminately cannibalize each other 
during foraging behavior. Fish produce large numbers of tiny young, and adults exhibit about as much 
individual recognition of their offspring as humans do for a handful of raisins. Fish eggs, larvae, and juveniles 
are easily available, nutrient-rich meals, and with thousands of eggs in a clutch, plenty are still available to hatch 
after the adults have snacked. Baby fish aren’t just at risk of being 
cannibalized by adults— siblings eat each other too. Sand tiger shark eggs develop and hatch inside their mother’s oviducts 
at different times. When the hatchlings run out of yolk 
from their own eggs, they eat the other eggs and hatchlings until one baby shark
from each oviduct remains. When they emerge, the young sharks 
are well-nourished, experienced predators who stand a better chance of surviving. Even when they aren’t consumed 
for nutrition, young animals are especially 
vulnerable to cannibalism. Hamsters, rats, and other rodent mothers will eat some of their young
if they’re sick, dead, or simply too numerous to feed. In other mammals, 
including bears and lions, males will kill offspring 
sired by another. That’s because childless females become 
receptive to mating more quickly than if they were caring for a cub. Rather than waste nutritious meat,
the males then eat the dead cubs. Meanwhile, cannibalism is less common 
in birds than in other groups, but certain species will eat diseased
or dead hatchlings as a way of disposing of the
bodies before they can attract maggots. When adults eat each other, males are
cannibalized more often than females, usually during mating 
and generally because they’re smaller. Male Australian redback spiders
mate with much larger females. Rather than scrambling away after mating, 
the tiny male does a somersault, bringing his abdomen into contact 
with his mate’s mouthparts. The female showers him with enzyme-rich 
gut juice and consumes his abdomen. Males not killed in the initial mating 
crawl back into the fray, often half-eaten, to mate again, after which they’re 
dispatched to the spider pantry. So not only does the male provide 
the female with his sperm, but he also provides her with 
a nutritious meal to better ensure that she’ll
survive to pass on his genes. All in all, it’s clear 
that cannibalism is as much a part of life 
in the animal kingdom as other, better-recognized behaviors. As we sink our teeth into the evidence 
of cannibalism in nature, we might ask ourselves, what else have we missed by applying
human standards to the natural world?"
11,BvLolPN8NvU,A simple way to tell insects apart - Anika Hazra,"A whip-like straw. Powerful, crushing blades. A pointed, piercing tube. There are nearly a million 
known insect species in the world, but most have one of just 
five common types of mouthparts. And that’s extremely useful to scientists because when they encounter 
an unfamiliar insect in the wild, they can learn a lot about it 
just by examining how it eats. Scientific classification, or taxonomy, is used to organize all 
living things into seven levels: kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. The features of an insect’s mouthparts can
help identify which order it belongs to, while also providing clues about how 
it evolved and what it feeds on. The chewing mouthpart is the most common. It’s also the most primitive— all other mouthparts are thought to have 
started out looking like this one before evolving into something different. It features a pair 
of jaws called mandibles with toothed inner edges that cut up 
and crush solid foods, like leaves or other insects. You can find this mouthpart 
on ants from the Hymenoptera order, grasshoppers and crickets 
of the Orthoptera order, dragonflies of the Odonata order, and beetles of the Coleoptera order. The piercing-sucking mouthpart consists of
a long, tube-like structure called a beak. This beak can pierce plant 
or animal tissue to suck up liquids like sap or blood. It can also secrete saliva 
with digestive enzymes that liquefy food for easier sucking. Insects in the Hemiptera order 
have piercing-sucking mouthparts and include bed bugs, cicadas, aphids, and leafhoppers. The siphoning mouthpart, a friendlier version 
of the piercing and sucking beak, also consists of a long, tube-like 
structure called a proboscis that works like a straw 
to suck up nectar from flowers. Insects of the Lepidoptera order— butterflies and moths— keep their proboscises rolled
up tightly beneath their heads when they’re not feeding and unfurl them when 
they come across some sweet nectar. With the sponging mouthpart,
there’s yet another tube, this time ending in two spongy lobes that contain many finer 
tubes called pseudotracheae. The pseudotracheae secrete 
enzyme-filled saliva and soak up fluids 
and dissolved foods by capillary action. House flies, fruit flies, and the other non-biting 
members of the Diptera order are the only insects 
that use this technique. But, there’s a catch. Biting flies within Diptera, like mosquitoes, horse flies, and deer flies, have a piercing-sucking mouthpart 
instead of the sponging mouthpart. And finally, the chewing-lapping mouthpart
is a combination of mandibles and a proboscis with a tongue-like 
structure at its tip for lapping up nectar. On this type of mouthpart, the mandibles themselves 
are not actually used for eating. For bees and wasps,
members of the Hymenoptera order, they serve instead as tools 
for pollen-collecting and wax-molding. Of course, in nature, there are always 
exceptions to the rules. The juvenile stages of some insects, 
for example, have completely different kinds 
of mouths than their adult versions, like caterpillars, which use chewing 
mouthparts to devour leaves before metamorphosing into
butterflies and moths with siphoning mouthparts. Still, mouthpart identification can, 
for the most part, help scientists—and you
—categorize insects. So why not break out a magnifying lens and learn a little more about
who’s nibbling your vegetable garden, biting your arm, or just flying by your ear."
12,y6u1GPpJuR4,Why do animals form swarms? - Maria R. D'Orsogna,"When desert locusts are well fed,
they're solitary creatures. But when food becomes scarce, hungry, desperate locusts
crowd onto small patches of land where they can still find 
something to eat. Contact between different locusts'
hind legs set off a slew of reactions that change their appearance and behavior. Now, instead of shunning their peers,
they seek each other out. The locusts eventually start marching
and then fly away in large numbers seeking a better habitat. These gigantic swarms can host
millions of insects and travel thousands of miles, devastating vegetation and crops. They stay close to each other,
but not too close, or they might get eaten
by their hungry neighbors. When many individual organisms, like locusts, bacteria, anchovies, or bats, come together and move 
as one coordinated entity, that's a swarm. From a handful of birds 
to billions of insects, swarms can be almost any size. But what they have in common
is that there's no leader. Members of the swarm interact
only with their nearest neighbors or through indirect cues. Each individual follows simple rules: Travel in the same direction 
as those around you, stay close, and avoid collisions. There are many benefits to traveling
in a group like this. Small prey may fool predators
by assembling into a swarm that looks like a much bigger organism. And congregating in a large group reduces the chance that any single 
individual will be captured. Moving in the same direction
as your neighbors saves energy by sharing the effort
of fighting wind or water resistance. It may even be easier 
to find a mate in a swarm. Swarming can also allow groups of animals to accomplish tasks 
they couldn’t do individually. When hundreds or millions or organisms
follow the same simple rules, sophisticated behavior called
swarm intelligence may arise. A single ant can't do much on its own, but an ant colony 
can solve complex problems, like building a nest and finding the shortest path
to a food source. But sometimes, things can go wrong. In a crowd, diseases spread more easily, and some swarming organisms may start
eating each other if food is scarce. Even some of the benefits of swarms,
like more efficient navigation, can have catastrophic consequences. Army ants are one example. They lay down chemicals called pheromones which signal their neighbors 
to follow the trail. This is good if the head of the group
is marching towards a food source. But occasionally the ants in the front
can veer off course. The whole swarm can get caught
in a loop following the pheromone trail until they die of exhaustion. Humans are notoriously individualistic,
though social, animals. But is there anything we can learn
from collective swarm-based organization? When it comes to technology,
the answer is definitely yes. Bats can teach drones how to navigate
confined spaces without colliding, fish can help design software
for safer driving, and insects are inspiring robot teams that
can assist search and rescue missions. For swarms of humans, 
it's perhaps more complicated and depends on the motives and leadership. Swarm behavior in human populations can
sometimes manifest as a destructive mob. But collective action can also produce
a crowd-sourced scientific breakthrough and artistic expression, or a peaceful global revolution."
13,Hja0SLs2kus,The amazing ways plants defend themselves - Valentin Hammoudi,"This is a tomato plant, and this is an aphid slowly killing
the tomato plant by sucking the juice out of its leaves. The tomato is putting up a fight
using both physical and chemical defenses to repel the attacking insects. But that's not all. The tomato is also releasing compounds
that signal nearby tomato plants to release their own insect repellent. Plants are constantly under attack. They face threats ranging from 
microscopic fungi and bacteria, small herbivores, like aphids,
caterpillars, and grasshoppers, up to large herbivores, like tortoises,
koalas, and elephants. All are looking to devour plants
to access the plentiful nutrients and water in their leaves, stems,
fruits, and seeds. But plants are ready with a whole
series of internal and external defenses that make them a much less 
appealing meal, or even a deadly one. Plants' defenses start at their surface. The bark covering tree trunks is full
of lignin, a rigid web of compounds that's
tough to chew and highly impermeable to pathogens. Leaves are protected by
a waxy cuticle that deters insects and microbes. Some plants go a step further
with painful structures to warn would-be predators. Thorns, spines, and prickles
discourage bigger herbivores. To deal with smaller pests, some plants'
leaves have sharp hair-like structures called trichomes. The kidney bean plant sports tiny
hooks to stab the feet of bed bugs and other insects. In some species, trichomes also dispense
chemical irritants. Stinging nettles release a mixture
of histamine and other toxins that cause pain and inflammation
when touched. For other plant species, the pain comes
after an herbivore's first bite. Spinach, kiwi fruit, pineapple, fuchsia and rhubarb all produce microscopic
needle-shaped crystals called raphides. They can cause tiny wounds in the inside
of animals' mouths, which create entry points for toxins. The mimosa plant has a strategy
designed to prevent herbivores from taking a bite at all. Specialized mechanoreceptor cells
detect touch and shoot an electrical signal
through the leaflet to its base causing cells there to release
charged particles. The buildup of charge draws
water out of these cells and they shrivel, 
pulling the leaflet closed. The folding movement scares insects away and the shrunken leaves look less
appealing to larger animals. If these external defenses are breached, the plant immune system 
springs into action. Plants don't have a separate immune system
like animals. Instead, every cell has the ability
to detect and defend against invaders. Specialized receptors can recognize 
molecules that signal the presence of dangerous microbes or insects. In response, the immune system initiates 
a battery of defensive maneuvers. To prevent more pathogens from making
their way inside, the waxy cuticle thickens and cell walls
get stronger. Guard cells seal up pores in the leaves. And if microbes are devouring one section
of the plant, those cells can self-destruct 
to quarantine the infection. Compounds toxic to microbes and insects
are also produced, often tailor-made for a specific threat. Many of the plant molecules that humans
have adopted as drugs, medicines and seasonings evolved as part of plants' immune systems
because they're antimicrobial, or insecticidal. An area of a plant under attack can alert
other regions using hormones, airborne compounds, or even electrical signals. When other parts of the plant detect
these signals, they ramp up production
of defensive compounds. And for some species, like tomatoes, this early warning system also
alerts their neighbors. Some plants can even recruit
allies to adopt a strong offense against their would-be attackers. Cotton plants under siege by caterpillars release a specific cocktail of ten
to twelve chemicals into the air. This mixture attracts parasitic wasps 
that lay eggs inside the caterpillars. Plants may not be able to flee the scene
of an attack, or fight off predators with teeth
and claws, but with sturdy armor, a well-stocked chemical arsenal, a neighborhood watch, and cross-species alliances, a plant isn't always an easy meal."
14,8RI0JnB_OaE,The ferocious predatory dinosaurs of Cretaceous Sahara - Nizar Ibrahim,"There are few places on Earth 
less hospitable to life than the bone-dry Sahara Desert. Yet it wasn't always this way. 100 million years ago, during a period
known as the Mid-Cretaceous, a gargantuan river system flowed
across the region from modern day Egypt to Morocco. The whole world at that time
would look rather different to us. The continents had yet to assume
their current positions. Extreme temperatures were common and fierce storms made life unpredictable. Dinosaurs flourished on land, pterosaurs roamed the skies, and giant marine reptiles and sharks
swam in warm seas. Small mammals, our ancestors,
lived quite literally in the shadow of these extraordinary creatures. In this world of huge predators, the River of Giants, which is what some call this region
of what is now northern Africa, stood out as particularly dangerous. In most ecosystems, it's lonely at
the top of the food chain. There usually isn't enough prey
to sustain many predators. Yet an incredible variety of aquatic
prey species in the river-based ecosystem may have allowed a large and diverse
population of apex predators to coexist. We know this thanks to a wealth of fossils
we found in an area called the Kem Kem Beds. Many of the predators we've discovered
had head and body shapes that made them uniquely adapted
to hunt the different types and sizes of aquatic prey. This allowed many Kem Kem predators to
take full advantage of the one abundant food source
in this environment: fish. This also allowed them 
to avoid direct competition with the predators going after
land-loving animals. Prey species in the river system had to
contend with attacks from all sides, including from above. Flying reptiles dominated the skies. Alanqa Saharica had a wingspan of
up to nine meters, and long slender jaws that helped it
snatch fish and small terrestrial animals. At least seven different types 
of crocodile-like predators patrolled the waterways, including the roughly 
ten-meter-long Elosuchus. And multiple species of T-rex-sized
carnivorous dinosaurs called theropods, lived side by side. In the River of Giants,
Spinosaurus was king. This 15-meter-long dinosaur was even
longer than T-rex, with short muscular hind legs, a flexible tail, and broad feet. It's two-meter-high sail warned
other creatures of its fearsome size and may have also been 
used to attract mates. Spinosaurus' long slender jaws were spiked
with conical teeth, perfect for swiftly clamping down
on slippery aquatic prey. This apex predator, 
as well as its ecosystem, is unparalleled in the history
of life on Earth. All that's left of these 
fearsome predators are fossils. About 93 million years ago, 
sea levels rose, submerging the Kem Kem region
in a shallow sea. Tens of millions of years later, an asteroid impact, volcanic eruptions, and associated changes in climate wiped out the dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and
many other groups of animals and plants, including their unique ecoysystems. That mass extinction paved the way
for the rise of new kinds of birds, larger mammals, and eventually us."
15,sz3Yv3On4lE,The three different ways mammals give birth - Kate Slabosky,"What do these animals have in common? More than you might think. Along with over 5,000 other species,
they're mammals, or members of class mammalia. All mammals are vertebrates,
meaning they have backbones. But mammals are distinguished 
from other vertebrates by a number of shared features. That includes warm blood, body hair or fur, the ability to breathe using lungs, and nourishing their young with milk. But despite these similarities, these creatures also have 
many biological differences, and one of the most remarkable
is how they give birth. Let's start with the most familiar,
placental mammals. This group includes humans, cats, dogs, giraffes, and even the blue whale,
the biggest animal on Earth. Its placenta, a solid disk
of blood-rich tissue, attaches to the wall of the uterus
to support the developing embryo. The placenta is what keeps
the calf alive during pregnancy. Directly connected to 
the mother's blood supply, it funnels nutrients and oxygen 
straight into the calf's body via the umbilical cord, and also exports its waste. Placental mammals can spend far
longer inside the womb than other mammals. Baby blue whales, for instance, spend
almost a full year inside their mother. The placenta keeps the calf alive
right up until its birth, when the umbilical cord breaks and the newborn's own respiratory, circulatory, and waste disposal systems take over. Measuring about 23 feet,
a newborn calf is already able to swim. It will spend the next six months drinking 225 liters of 
its mothers thick, fatty milk per day. Meanwhile, in Australia,
you can find a second type of mammal - marsupials. Marsupial babies are so tiny and delicate
when they're born that they must continue developing
in the mother's pouch. Take the quoll, one of the world's
smallest marsupials, which weighs only 18 milligrams at birth, the equivalent of about 30 sugar grains. The kangaroo, another marsupial, gives birth to a single 
jelly bean-sized baby at a time. The baby crawls down the middle
of the mother's three vaginas, then must climb up to the pouch, where she spends 
the next 6-11 months suckling. Even after the baby kangaroo leaves
this warm haven, she'll return to suckle milk. Sometimes, she's just one of three babies
her mother is caring for. A female kangaroo can often simultaneously
support one inside her uterus and another in her pouch. In unfavorable conditions, female kangaroos can pause
their pregnancies. When that happens, she's able
to produce two different kinds of milk, one for her newborn, and one for her older joey. The word mammalia means of the breast, which is a bit of a misnomer because while kangaroos do produce
milk from nipples in their pouches, they don't actually have breasts. Nor do monotremes, the third and arguably
strangest example of mammalian birth. There were once hundreds 
of monotreme species, but there are only five left: four species of echidnas
and the duck-billed platypus. The name monotreme means one hole referring to the single orifice they use
for reproduction, excretion, and egg-laying. Like birds, reptiles, fish, dinosaurs, and others, these species lay eggs instead
of giving birth to live young. Their eggs are soft-shelled, and when their babies hatch, they suckle
milk from pores on their mother's body until they're large enough 
to feed themselves. Despite laying eggs and other adaptations
that we associate more with non-mammals, like the duck-bill platypus's webbed feet, bill, and the venomous spur 
males have on their feet, they are, in fact, mammals. That's because they share the defining
characteristics of mammalia and are evolutionarily linked
to the rest of the class. Whether placental, marsupial, or monotreme, each of these creatures and its unique
birthing methods, however bizarre, have succeeded for many millennia
in bringing new life and diversity into the mammal kingdom."
16,7m8QlSPP7t0,Why do animals have such different lifespans? - Joao Pedro de Magalhaes,"For the microscopic lab worm, C. elegans life equates to just 
a few short weeks on Earth. Compare that with the tortoise,
which can age to more than 100 years. Mice and rats reach the end of their lives
after just four years, while for the bowhead whale,
Earth's longest-lived mammal, death can come after 200. Like most living things, the vast majority of animals gradually
degenerate after reaching sexual maturity in the process known as aging. But what does it really mean to age? The drivers behind this process are varied
and complicated, but aging is ultimately 
caused by cell death and dysfunction. When we're young, 
we constantly regenerate cells in order to replace dead and dying ones. But as we age, this process slows down. In addition, older cells don't perform
their functions as well as young ones. That makes our bodies go into a decline, which eventually results 
in disease and death. But if that's consistently true, why the huge variance in aging patterns
and lifespan within the animal kingdom? The answer lies in several factors, including environment and body size. These can place powerful evolutionary
pressures on animals to adapt, which in turn makes the aging process
different across species. Consider the cold depths of the Atlantic
and Arctic Seas, where Greenland sharks can live
to over 400 years, and the Arctic clam known as the quahog
can live up to 500. Perhaps the most impressive of these
ocean-dwelling ancients is the Antarctic glass sponge, which can survive over 10,000 years
in frigid waters. In cold environments like these,
heartbeats and metabolic rates slow down. Researchers theorize that this also
causes a slowing of the aging process. In this way, the environment 
shapes longevity. When it comes to size, 
it's often, but not always, the case that larger species have a longer
lifespan than smaller ones. For instance, an elephant or whale
will live much longer than a mouse, rat, or vole, which in turn have years on flies
and worms. Some small animals, like worms and flies, are also limited by the mechanics 
of their cell division. They're mostly made up of cells that can't
divide and be replaced when damaged, so their bodies expire more quickly. And size is a powerful evolutionary driver
in animals. Smaller creatures are more prone
to predators. A mouse, for instance, can hardly expect
to survive more than a year in the wild. So, it has evolved to grow and reproduce
more rapidly, like an evolutionary defense mechanism
against its shorter lifespan. Larger animals, by contrast, are better
at fending off predators, and so they have the luxury of time
to grow to large sizes and reproduce multiple times
during their lives. Exceptions to the size rule include bats,
birds, moles, and turtles, but in each case, these animals have other
adaptations that allow them to escape predators. But there are still cases where animals
with similar defining features, like size and habitat, age at completely different rates. In these cases, genetic differences, like how each organism's cells
respond to threats, often account for the discrepancies
in longevity. So it's the combination 
of all these factors playing out to differing degrees
in different animals that explains the variability we see
in the animal kingdom. So what about us? Humans currently have 
an average life expectancy of 71 years, meaning that we're not even close to being
the longest living inhabitants on Earth. But we are very good at increasing
our life expectancy. In the early 1900s, humans only lived
an average of 50 years. Since then, we've learned to adapt
by managing many of the factors that cause deaths, like environmental exposure
and nutrition. This, and other increases 
in life expectancy make us possibly the only species
on Earth to take control over our natural fate."
17,5j9Syov0AAw,How do animals experience pain? - Robyn J. Crook,"Humans know the surprising
prick of a needle, the searing pain of a stubbed toe 
and the throbbing of a toothache. We can identify many types of pain 
and have multiple ways of treating it. But what about other species? How do the animals all around us 
experience pain? It’s important that we find out. We keep animals as pets,
they enrich our environment, we farm many species for food, and we use them in experiments to advance
science and human health. Animals are clearly important to us, so it’s equally important that we
avoid causing them unnecessary pain. For animals that are similar to us,
like mammals, it's often obvious when they're hurting. But there's a lot that isn't obvious, like whether pain relievers that
work on us also help them. And the more different
an animal is from us, the harder it is to understand
their experience. How do you tell whether a shrimp 
is in pain? A snake? A snail? In vertebrates— including humans— pain 
can be split into two distinct processes. In the first, nerves in the skin 
sense something harmful and communicate that information
to the spinal cord. There, motor neurons activate movements
that make us rapidly jerk away from the threat. This is the physical recognition of harm 
called nociception. And nearly all animals, even those
with very simple nervous systems, experience it. Without this ability, animals would be 
unable to avoid harm and their survival would be threatened. The second part is the conscious
recognition of harm. In humans, this occurs when the sensory
neurons in our skin make a second round of connections 
via the spinal cord to the brain. There, millions of neurons in multiple
regions create the sensations of pain. For us, this is a very complex experience
associated with emotions like fear, panic and stress, 
which we can communicate to others. But it’s harder to know exactly 
how animals experience this part the process, because most of them
can’t show us what they feel. However, we get clues from observing
how animals behave. Wild, hurt animals are known
to nurse their wounds, make noises to show their distress,
and become reclusive. in the lab, scientists have discovered 
that animals like chickens and rats will self-administer pain-reducing 
drugs if they’re hurting. Animals also avoid situations 
where they’ve been hurt before, which suggests awareness of threats. We’ve reached the point that
research has made us so sure that vertebrates recognize pain that it’s illegal in many countries
to needlessly harm these animals. But what about other types 
of animals, like invertebrates? These animals aren't legally protected, partly because their behaviors
are harder to read. We can make good guesses about some of
them, like oysters, worms and jellyfish. These are examples of animals 
that either lack a brain or have a very simple one. So an oyster may recoil when squirted
with lemon juice, for instance, because of nociception. But with such a simple nervous system, it’s unlikely to experience 
the conscious part of pain. Other invertebrate animals are 
more complicated, though. Like the octopus, 
which has a sophisticated brain and is thought to be one of the most 
intelligent invertebrate animals. Yet in many countries, people continue
the practice of eating live octopus. We also boil live crayfish,
shrimp, and crabs, even though we don't really know
how they're affected either. This poses an ethical problem, because we may be causing these
animals unnecessary suffering. Scientific experimentation, 
though controversial, gives us some clues. Tests on hermit crabs show that they’ll
leave an undesirable shell if they’re zapped with electricity. But stay if it’s a good shell. And octopi that might originally 
curl up an injured arm to protect it, will risk using it to catch prey. That suggests that these animals make
value judgments around sensory input, instead of just reacting
reflexively to harm. Meanwhile, crabs have been known
to repeatedly rub a spot on their bodies where they’ve received an electric shock. And even sea slugs flinch when they
know they’re about to receive a noxious stimulus. That means they have
some memory of physical sensations. We still have a lot to learn
about animal pain. As our knowledge grows, it may
one day allow us to live in a world where we don’t cause pain needlessly."
18,gBRcOLcEwF0,What’s so great about the Great Lakes? - Cheri Dobbs and Jennifer Gabrys,"What's so great about the Great Lakes? They're known as America's inland seas. The North American Great Lakes Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, and Superior are so massive
that they border eight states and contain 23 quadrillion
liters of water. That's enough to cover the land area
of the contiguous United States three meters deep. These vast bodies of water span forest, grassland, and wetland habitats, supporting a region that's home to over
3,500 species. But how did such a vast and unique
geological feature come to be? The story begins near the end
of the last ice age over 10,000 years ago, a time when the climate was warming and the glaciers that cloaked the Earth's
surface began their slow retreat. These immense ice sheets carved out
a series of basins. Those basins filled with water
as the ice began to melt, creating the world's largest area
of freshwater lakes. Over time, channels developed between
these basins, and water began to flow in
an ongoing exchange that persists to this day. In fact, today,
the interconnected Great Lakes contain almost 20% of the world's supply
of fresh surface water. The water's journey begins in
the far north of Lake Superior, which is the deepest, coldest,
and clearest of the lakes, containing half the system's water. Lake Superior sinks to depths
of 406 meters, creating a unique and diverse ecosystem
that includes more that 80 fish species. A given drop of water spends on average
200 years in this lake before flowing into Lake Michigan
or Lake Huron. Linked by the Straits of Mackinac,
these two lakes are technically one. To the west lies Lake Michigan, the third largest of the lakes
by surface area. Water slowly moves through
its cul-de-sac shape and encounters the world's largest
freshwater dunes, many wildlife species, and unique fossilized coral. To the east is Lake Huron,
which has the longest shoreline. It's sparsely populated,
but heavily forested, including 7,000-year-old petrified trees. Below them, water continues to flow
southeastwards from Lake Huron into Lake Erie. This lake's status as the warmest
and shallowest of the five has ensured an abundance of animal life,
including millions of migrating birds. Finally, the water reaches its last stop
by dramatically plunging more than 50 meters down
the thundering Niagara Falls into Lake Ontario, the smallest lake
by surface area. From there, some of this well-traveled
water enters the St. Lawrence River, eventually reaching the Atlantic Ocean. In addition to being a natural wonder, the perpetually flowing Great Lakes
bring us multiple benefits. They provide natural water filtration, flood control, and nutrients cycling. By moving water across
more than 3,200 kilometers, the Great Lakes also provide drinking
water for upward of 40 million people and 212 billion liters a day
for the industries and farms that line their banks. But our dependence on the system is
having a range of negative impacts, too. The Great Lakes coastal habitats are being
degraded and increasingly populated, exposing the once pristine waters to industrial, urban,
and agricultural pollutants. Because less than 1% of the water
leaves the Lake's system annually, decades-old pollutants still lurk
in its waters. Humans have also inadvertently introduced more than 100 non-native
and invasive species into the lakes, such as zebra and quagga mussels,
and sea lampreys that have decimated some indigenous
fish populations. On a larger scale, climate change
is causing the waters to warm, thus reducing water levels and changing
the distribution of aquatic life. Luckily, in recent years, governments have
started to recognize the immense value of this natural resource. Partnerships between the United States and
Canada are underway to reduce pollution, protect coastal habitats, and halt the spread of invasive species. Protecting something as massive
as the Great Lakes system will require the collaboration
of many organizations, but the effort is critical if we can preserve the wonder
of this flowing inland sea."
19,QtJqBiF6EF0,Why do we kiss under mistletoe? - Carlos Reif,"The sight of mistletoe may either send
you scurrying or if you have your eye on someone, awaiting an opportunity
beneath its snow white berries. But how did the festive Christmas 
tradition of kissing under mistletoe come about? The long lived custom intertwines 
the mythology and biology of this intriguing plant. There are more than 1,000 species of
mistletoe which grows the world over. In fact, the ancient Europeans
were so captivated by the plant’s unusual growth habits 
that they included it in their legends and myths. In ancient Rome, Pliny the Elder 
described how the Druid priesthood in ancient England
believed that mistletoe was a plant dropped down from heaven 
by the gods; that explained its unlikely position 
amongst the high branches of certain trees. They also believed it had powers 
of healing and bestowing fertility. Meanwhile, Scandinavian legends told 
of the plant’s mystical qualities in the story of the god Baldur
and his adoring mother, Frigg, goddess of love, marriage and fertility. Frigg loved her son so much 
that she commanded every plant, animal and inanimate object to vow 
they’d never harm him. In her fervor, however, 
she overlooked the mistletoe. The mischievous god Loki realized 
this oversight, and pierced Baldur’s heart with an arrow 
carved from a mistletoe branch. Frigg cried tears of such
sadness that they formed the mistletoe’s pearly berries, making the other gods pity her 
and agree to resurrect Baldur. Hearing the news, Frigg became 
so overjoyed that she transformed the mistletoe from a symbol of death
into one of peace and love. She mandated a one day
truce for all fights and that everyone embraced beneath 
its branches when they passed to spread more love into the world. In the 17th century, British colonists 
arriving in the New World found a different but very similar looking
species of mistletoe. They applied it to these tales
of magic, fertility and love, spreading the mistletoe hanging tradition
from Europe into America. By the 18th century, people 
in Britain had turned this into a Christmas tradition. But this custom comes down to more 
than just human imagination. All of it was inspired
by the plant’s intriguing biology. We see mistletoe as a festive decoration,
but draped on tree boughs in the wild, it’s known as a partly parasitic plant. Mistletoe relies on modified roots
called haustoria that penetrate the tree bark 
and siphon off the water and minerals trees carry up their trunks. To colonize nearby trees with its seeds, mistletoe depends on birds 
and other creatures to do the dispersing. Birds that eat the mistletoe’s 
sticky white berries sometimes get rid of the gluey seeds
by wiping them off onto tree bark, or with a bit of luck, they excrete the indigestible seed
onto a tree where it germinates and starts to grow. With its resilience and foliage 
that stays lush even while the surrounding trees 
lose their leaves, you can see why mistletoe captivated
our superstitious ancestors. They saw these as signs of the plant’s
magical qualities and fertility. Even today, the mistletoe inspires wonder with the diversity of wildlife
it supports. More than just a parasite, 
it’s also known as a keystone species. It's eaten by a diversity of animals,
including deer, elk, squirrels, chipmunks, porcupines, robins, bluebirds, 
mourning doves, and the butterfly genus Delius. Some mistletoe species
produce dense bushes, which are excellent nesting locations
for a variety of birds. And despite their parasitic
relationship with trees, mistletoes can also help other plants. For instance, juniper sprouts 
near mistletoe to benefit from the visiting berry-eating birds. Through the many benefits it provides, mistletoe influences diversity 
and allows ecosystems to flourish. You might even say, 
that for this iconic plant, life imitates legend. In the wild, mistletoe has the power 
to bring things together. And in our own traditions 
we see that happening too."
20,GLllZ-qiXJA,Do we really need pesticides? - Fernan Pérez-Gálvez,"In 1845, Ireland's vast potato fields
were struck by an invasive fungal disease that rapidly infested this staple crop. The effect was devastating. One million people died of famine, and over a million more were forced
to leave Ireland. Nowadays, we avoid such agricultural
catastrophes with the help of pesticides. Those are a range of manmade chemicals
that control insects, unwanted weeds, funguses, rodents, and bacteria that may threaten our food supply. They've become an essential part
of our food system. As populations have grown,
monoculture, single crop farming, has helped us feed people efficiently. But it's also left our food
vulnerable to extensive attack by pests. In turn, we've become more dependent
on pesticides. Today, we annually shower over 5 billion
pounds of pesticides across the Earth to control these unwanted visitors. The battle against pests,
especially insects, has marked agriculture's long history. Records from thousands of years ago suggest that humans actively burned
some of their crops after harvest to rid them of pests. There's even evidence from ancient times
that we recruited other insects to help. In 300 A.D., Chinese farmers specially
bred ferocious predatory ants in orange orchards
to protect the trees from other bugs. Later, as large-scale farming spread, we began sprinkling arsenic, lead,
and copper treatments on crops. But these were incredibly toxic
to humans as well. As our demand for more, 
safer produce increased, so did the need for effective chemicals that could control pests
on a grander scale. This ushered in the era 
of chemical pesticides. In 1948, a Swiss chemist named
Paul Hermann Müller was awarded a Nobel Prize 
for his discovery of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane,
also known as DDT. This new molecule had unparalleled power
to control many insect species until the 1950s,
when insects became resistant to it. Worse, the chemical actually drove
dramatic declines in bird populations, poisoned water sources, and was eventually found to cause
long-term health problems in humans. By 1972, DDT had been banned
in the United States, and yet traces still linger
in the environment today. Since then, chemists have been searching
for alternatives. With each new wave of inventions,
they've encountered the same obstacle - rapid species evolution. As pesticides destroy pest populations, they leave behind 
only the most resistant individuals. They then pass on their 
pesticide-resisting genes to the next generation. That's lead to the rise of super bugs, such as the Colorado potato beetle, which is resistant to over 
50 different insecticides. Another downside is that other bugs
get caught in the crossfire. Some of these are helpful predators
of plant pests or vital pollinators, so erasing them from agriculture
wipes out their benefits, too. Pesticides have improved over time and are currently regulated by strict
safety standards, but they still have the potential
to pollute soil and water, impact wildlife, and even harm us. So considering all these risks,
why do we continue using pesticides? Although they're imperfect, they currently may be our best bet
against major agricultural disasters, not to mention mosquito-born diseases. Today, scientists are on a quest for
alternative pest control strategies that balance the demands
of food production with environmental concerns. Nature has become a major source
of inspiration, from natural plant and fungal chemicals
that can repel or attract insects, to recruiting other insects 
as crop bodyguards. We're also turning to high-tech solutions,
like drones. Programmed to fly over crops, these machines can use 
their sensors and GPS to carry out more targeted sprays that limit a pesticide's wider 
environmental impact. With a combination 
of biological understanding, environmental awareness, and improved technologies, we have a better chance of finding
a holistic solution to pests. Chemical pesticides may never shake
their controversial reputation, but with their help, we can ensure that 
agricultural catastrophes stay firmly in our past."
21,mQePz62zkqA,Why are there so many types of apples? - Theresa Doud,"Have you ever walked into a grocery store and wondered where all those variety
of apples came from? You might find SnapDragon, Pixie Crunch, Cosmic Crisp, Jazz, or Ambrosia next to the more familiar
Red Delicious and Granny Smith. These delightfully descriptive names belong to just a handful of the over
7,500 apple varieties in the world. This huge diversity exists largely because
of humanity's efforts to bear new fruit. Fruit breeding is a way to fulfill
the expectations of farmers and consumers who seek specific qualities in an apple. On the one hand, farmers may want them
to be disease-resistant and to store well. On the other, consumers are swayed
by appearance, taste, and novelty. So, breeders have to consider everything from how well apples grow
in certain climates to their color, taste, and size. And sometimes finding the perfect
fit means breeding something new. To create apples 
with desirable characteristics, breeders first need to find parent
apples that carry those characteristics. Once the parents have been selected, they have to wait until the trees
bloom in the spring. The breeder takes the pollen
from one bloom, called the father, and transfers it by hand to the other
parent bloom, called the mother, through a process 
called cross-pollination. Once the mother bloom 
turns into an apple, the seeds are collected and then planted. It takes about five years for these seeds
to grow into trees that produce apples, but because of the way 
traits are inherited, all of the seedlings produced will have
different sets of genes and characteristics. This means that to achieve 
a desired quality, it takes a lot of offspring, not to mention patience 
on the breeder's part. When a seedling does bear fruit
with the desired qualities, it's selected for further evaluation. Of the original crossed seedlings, about one in every 5,000 makes it
to this prestigious stage. They're then sent to new farms where breeders can assess how various
climates and soil types affect the plant's growth. The fruit of the seedling 
and its many clones must then be collected and sampled
to ensure consistency. Breeders study about 45 traits
in an apple, like the texture 
and firmness of the flesh, when it ripens, how sugary its juice is, and how long it stays fresh. Over several years, they weed out
all the bad apples, selecting only those 
whose fruits are the best. These exclusive plants 
officially form the cultivar, or new apple variety. To ensure an exact copy of this cultivar, all apple trees must be grafted 
from the original seedling. Branches, called scion wood, are cut from the original tree 
and grown to generate more scion wood. Segments of these trees are then grafted
onto root stalk - that's the lower section of another tree that's been chosen 
from a different cultivar for its superior roots 
and growing ability. Finally, this fusion creates 
a new apple tree with the desired qualities. Each new plant takes up to four years before it starts producing 
the fruit we eat. Apple breeding may be a difficult art,
but it's accessible to all: universities, companies, and even individuals can create
new cultivars. But to fully own an apple, the breeder
faces a final challenge - naming the fruit. After a cultivar is patented, a breeder chooses a name
for its trademark. That final step grants them long-lasting
rights over the apple and its clones. That name must be completely original, and the catchier, the better, of course. With over 7,500 varieties and counting, that's why we have apples called
Pink Lady, Sweet Tango, Kiku, and EverCrisp. The more we work with nature's bounty
to breed new cultivars, the more creative and delectable
these names will become."
22,gFzqqaBA9wQ,How smart are orangutans? - Lu Gao,"Fu Manchu was one of the most
notorious escape artists at the Omaha Zoo in the 1960s. But he wasn't a performer, he was an orangutan. The keepers who locked 
his enclosure every night were baffled to find him outside
the next day hanging out with friends in a tree, or sunning on the roof. Only after installing cameras 
did they realize Fu Manchu had been picking the lock with a metal wire that he kept hidden
under his cheek pouch. The keepers shouldn't have been
surprised at Fu Manchu's cunningness. Along with our other great ape cousins, the gorillas, chimps, and bonobos, they belong to our Hominidae
family tree, which stretches back 14 million years. But it's not just their striking red hair that makes orangutans unique 
among our cousins. As the only great apes from Asia, orangutans have adapted to a life
high in the rain forest canopies. Many of the skills they learn
are transmitted through the special bond they have with their mothers, the most extended in the animal kingdom
next to humans. Orangutan mothers usually give birth
to one baby at a time, waiting up to eight years before
having another. This gives the young, who begin as fully dependent infants, plenty of time to learn how to climb and distinguish the hundreds of plants
and fruits that make up their diet. Female orangutans even stay with
their mothers into their teen years to learn child-rearing. As they grow up, orangutans also develop
a complex set of cooperative social skills by interacting with their peers
and siblings. Much like ourselves, young orangutans involuntarily mimic
the facial expressions and emotions of their playmates, with behaviors that closely parallel
human smiling and laughter. Once they finally venture out 
on their own, orangutans continue to develop
their resourcefulness, putting the skills they've learned 
into practice. Adults build a new nest each night
by carefully weaving twigs together, topping them with soft leaves,
pillows, and blankets. This process requires dexterity,
coordination, and an eye for design. Orangutans also use a variety of tools
to make their lives in the jungle easier. They turn branches into fly swatters
and back scratchers, construct umbrellas when it rains, make gloves from leafy pads, and even use leaves as bandages
to dress their wounds. But orangutan intelligence goes far
beyond jungle survival. Research in controlled environments
has shown that orangutans are self-aware, being one of the few species to recognize
their own reflections. They also display remarkable foresight,
planning, and cognition. In one experiment, researchers taught
an orangutan to use a straw to extract his favorite fruit soup
from a box. That orangutan was later given the choice
between the straw or a grape that could be 
eaten right away, and he chose the straw just in case
he was given another box of soup. In another experiment, orangutans figured
out how to reach peanuts at the bottom of long tubes
by spitting water into them. While orangutans are able to pass
cognitive tests with flying colors, there are certain problems that they
need our help to solve. Indonesia has the world's highest rate
of deforestation, and millions of acres of rain forest 
are burned annually to support the logging 
and palm oil industries. Deforestation exposes the 30,000
orangutans remaining in the wild to poachers. They kill mothers so that baby orangutans
can be sold as exotic pets. But fortunately, the story often
doesn't end here. Orphans can be confiscated
and given a second chance. At special forest schools, they recover
from emotional trauma and continue to develop 
essential life skills. Against all odds, these orphans 
demonstrate incredible resilience and readiness to learn. In Malay, the word orangutan translates
literally to ""the person of the forest,"" a reminder of our common lineage. And despite orangutans being some
of the smartest animals on Earth, outsmarting their extinction requires
the creativity, empathy, and foresight that our species share."
23,t3CjTU7TaNA,How do animals see in the dark? - Anna Stöckl,"To human eyes, the world at night
is a formless canvas of grey. Many nocturnal animals, on the other hand, experience a rich and varied world
bursting with details, shapes, and colors. What is it, then, that separates moths
from men? Moths and many other nocturnal animals
see at night because their eyes are adapted 
to compensate for the lack of light. All eyes, whether nocturnal or not, depend on photoreceptors in the retina
to detect light particles, known as photons. Photoreceptors then report information
about these photons to other cells in the retina and brain. The brain sifts through that information
and uses it to build up an image of the environment the eye perceives. The brighter the light is,
the more photons hit the eye. On a sunny day, upwards of 100 million times 
more photons are available to the eye than on a cloudy, moonless night. Photons aren't just less numerous 
in darkness, but they also hit the eye 
in a less reliable way. This means the information 
that photoreceptors collect will vary over time, as will the quality of the image. In darkness, trying to detect the sparse
scattering of randomly arriving photons is too difficult for the eyes
of most daytime animals. But for night creatures, 
it's just a matter of adaptation. One of these adaptations is size. Take the tarsier, whose eyeballs
are each as big as its brain, giving it the biggest eyes compared 
to head size of all mammals. If humans had the same brain to eye ratio,
our eyes would be the size of grapefruits. The tarsier's enlarged orbs haven't 
evolved to make it cuter, however, but to gather as much light as possible. Bigger eyes can have larger openings,
called pupils, and larger lenses, allowing for more light to be focused
on the receptors. While tarsiers scan the nocturnal scene
with their enormous peepers, cats use gleaming eyes to do the same. Cats' eyes get their shine from
a structure called the tapetum lucidum that sits behind the photoreceptors. This structure is made from layers
of mirror-like cells containing crystals that send incoming light
bouncing back towards the photoreceptors and out of the eye. This results in an eerie glow, and it also gives the photoreceptors
a second chance to detect photons. In fact, this system has inspired the
artificial cats' eyes we use on our roads. Toads, on the other hand, have adapted
to take it slow. They can form an image even when just a single photon 
hits each photoreceptor per second. They accomplish this with photoreceptors that are more than 25 times slower 
than human ones. This means toads can collect photons
for up to four seconds, allowing them to gather many more
than our eyes do at each visual time interval. The downside is that this causes toads
to react very slowly because they're only receiving
an updated image every four seconds. Fortunately, they're accustomed
to targeting sluggish prey. Meanwhile, the night is also buzzing
with insects, such as hawk moths, which can see their favorite flowers
in color, even on a starlit night. They achieve this by a surprising move - getting rid of details 
in their visual perception. Information from neighboring
photoreceptors is grouped in their brains, so the photon catch of each group
is higher compared to individual receptors. However, grouping photoreceptors
loses details in the image, as fine details require a fine grid
of photoreceptors, each detecting photons from one
small point in space. The trick is to balance the need
for photons with the loss of detail to still find their flowers. Whether eyes are slow, enormous,
shiny, or coarse, it's the combination 
of these biological adaptations that gives nocturnal animals their unique
visual powers. Imagine what it might be like to witness
through their eyes the world that wakes up
when the Sun goes down."
24,FK9xHry877U,What is the biggest single-celled organism? - Murry Gans,"The elephant is a creature
of epic proportions, and yet it owes its enormity to more
than 1,000 trillion microscopic cells, and on the epically small end of things, there are likely millions 
of unicellular species, yet there are very few we can see
with the naked eye. Why is that? Why don't we get unicellular elephants, or blue whales, or brown bears? To find out, we have to peer into
a cell's guts. This is where most 
of the cell's functions occur, enclosed by a cellular membrane that acts as the doorway into 
and out of the cell. Any resources the cell needs to consume, or waste products it needs to expel, first have to pass through this membrane. But there's a biological quirk 
in this set up. A cell's surface and volume increase
at different rates. Cells come in many shapes, but imagining them as cubes will make
the math easy to calculate. A cube has six faces. These represent the cell membrane,
and make up its surface area. A cube measuring one micrometer
on each side, that's one millionth of a meter, would have a total surface area
of six square micrometers. And its volume would be 
one cubic micrometer. This would give us six units 
of surface area for every single unit of volume, a six to one ratio. But things change dramatically
if we make the cube ten times bigger, measuring ten micrometers on each side. This cell would have a surface area
of 600 square micrometers and a volume of one thousand
cubic micrometers, a ratio of only .6 to one. That's less than one unit of surface area
to service each unit of volume. As the cube grows, its volume increases
much faster than its surface area. The interior would overtake the membrane, leaving too little surface area for things
to quickly move in and out of the cell. A huge cell would back up with waste
and eventually die and disintegrate. There's another plus to having multitudes
of smaller cells, too. It's hardly a tragedy if one gets 
punctured, infected, or destroyed. Now, there are some 
exceptionally large cells that have adapted to cheat the system, like the body's longest cell, a neuron that stretches from the base
of the spine to the foot. To compensate for its length,
it's really thin, just a few micrometers in diameter. Another example can be found
in your small intestine, where structures called villi
fold up into little fingers. Each villus is made of cells with highly
folded membranes that have tiny bumps called microvilli
to increase their surface area. But what about single-celled organisms? Caulerpa taxifolia, a green algae
that can reach 30 centimeters long, is believed to be the largest 
single-celled organism in the world thanks to its unique biological hacks. Its surface area is enhanced with
a frond-like structure. It uses photosynthesis to assemble
its own food molecules and it's coenocytic. That means it's a single cell
with multiple nuclei, making it like a multicellular organism
but without the divisions between cells. Yet even the biggest unicellular organisms
have limits, and none grows nearly as large
as the elephant, whale, or bear. But within every big creature
are trillions of minuscule cells perfectly suited in all their tininess to keeping the Earth's giants 
lumbering along."
25,dO2xx-aeZ4w,How a single-celled organism almost wiped out life on Earth - Anusuya Willis,"There's an organism 
that changed the world. It caused both the first mass extinction
in Earth's history and also paved the way for complex life. How? By sending the first free oxygen
molecules into our atmosphere, and they did all this
as single-celled life forms. They're cyanobacteria, and the story of these simple organisms that don't even have nuclei 
or any other organelles is a pivotal chapter 
in the story of life on Earth. Earth's atmosphere wasn't always 
the oxygen-rich mixture we breathe today. 3.5 billion years ago, the atmosphere
was mostly nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane. Almost all oxygen was locked up 
in molecules like water, not floating around in the air. The oceans were populated by
anaerobic microbes. Those are simple, unicellular life forms
that thrive without oxygen and get energy by scavenging
what molecules they find. But somewhere between 
2.5 and 3.5 billion years ago, one of these microbial species, probably floating 
on the surface of the ocean, evolved a new ability: photosynthesis. Structures in their cell membrane
could harness the energy from sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water
into oxygen gas and sugars, which they could use for energy. Those organisms were the ancestors
of what we now call cyanobacteria. Their bluish color comes from 
the blue-green pigments that capture the sunlight they need. Photosynthesis gave those ancient bacteria
a huge advantage over other species. They could now produce their own energy from an almost endless supply 
of raw ingredients, so their populations exploded and they started polluting the atmosphere
with a new waste product: oxygen. At first, the trickle of extra oxygen was
soaked up by chemical reactions with iron or decomposing cells, but after a few hundred million years, the cyanobacteria were producing oxygen
faster than it could be absorbed, and the gas started building up
in the atmosphere. That was a big problem for the rest
of Earth's inhabitants. Oxygen-rich air 
was actually toxic to them. The result? About 2.5 billion years ago was a mass
extinction of virtually all life on Earth, which barely spared the cyanobacteria. Geologists call this
the Great Oxygenation Event, or even the Oxygen Catastrophe. That wasn't the only problem. Methane had been acting as a potent
greenhouse gas that kept the Earth warm, but now, the extra oxygen reacted with
methane to form carbon dioxide and water, which don't trap as much heat. The thinner atmospheric blanket caused Earth's first, 
and possibly longest, ice age, the Huronian Glaciation. The planet was basically 
one giant snowball for several hundred million years. Eventually, life adjusted. Aerobic organisms, 
which can use oxygen for energy, started sopping up some of the excess
gas in the atmosphere. The oxygen concentration rose and fell until eventually it reached 
the approximate 21% we have today. And being able to use 
the chemical energy in oxygen gave organisms the boost they needed
to diversify and evolve more complex forms. Cyanobacteria had a part 
to play in that story, too. Hundreds of millions of years ago, some other prehistoric microbe
swallowed a cyanobacterium whole in a process called endosymbiosis. In doing so, that microbe acquired
its own internal photosynthesis factory. This was the ancestor of plant cells. And cyanobacteria became chloroplasts, the organelles that carry out 
photosynthesis today. Cyanobacteria are still around
in almost every environment on Earth: oceans, fresh water, soil, antarctic rocks, sloth fur. They still pump oxygen
into the atmosphere, and they also pull nitrogen out to
fertilize the plants they helped create. We wouldn't recognize life on Earth
without them. But also thanks to them, we almost didn't have 
life on Earth at all."
26,jzqnUvE66HA,How North America got its shape - Peter J. Haproff,"The geography of our planet is in flux. Each continent has ricocheted around
the globe on one or more tectonic plates, changing quite dramatically with time. Today, we'll focus on North America and how its familiar landscape
and features emerged over hundreds 
of millions of years. Our story begins about 
750 million years ago. As the super continent Rodinia
becomes unstable, it rifts along what's now the west coast
of North America to create the Panthalassa Ocean. You're seeing an ancestral continent
called Laurentia, which grows over the next few hundred
million years as island chains collide with it
and add land mass. We're now at 400 million years ago. Off today's east coast, the massive
African plate inches westward, closing the ancient Iapetus Ocean. It finally collides with Laurentia 
at 250 million years to form another supercontinent Pangea. The immense pressure causes
faulting and folding, stacking up rock to form 
the Appalachian Mountains. Let's fast forward a bit. About 100 million years later,
Pangea breaks apart, opening the Southern Atlantic Ocean between the new North American Plate
and the African Plate. We forge ahead, and now the eastward-moving 
Farallon Plate converges with the present-day west coast. The Farallon Plate's greater density
makes it sink beneath North America. This is called subduction, and it diffuses water into
the magma-filled mantle. That lowers the magma's melting point and makes it rise into the overlying
North American plate. From a subterranean chamber,
the magma travels upwards and erupts along a chain of volcanos. Magma still deep underground slowly cools, crystallizing to form solid rock, including the granite now found
in Yosemite National Park and the Sierra Nevada Mountains. We'll come back to that later. Now, it's 85 million years ago. The Farallon Plate becomes less steep, causing volcanism to stretch eastward
and eventually cease. As the Farallon Plate subducts, it compresses North America, thrusting up mountain ranges
like the Rockies, which extend over 3,000 miles. Soon after, the Eurasian Plate rifts
from North America, opening the North Atlantic Ocean. We'll fast forward again. The Colorado Plateau now uplifts, likely due to a combination
of upward mantle flow and a thickened North American Plate. In future millennia, the Colorado River
will eventually sculpt the plateau into the epic Grand Canyon. 30 million years ago, the majority of
the Farallon Plate sinks into the mantle, leaving behind only small corners 
still subducting. The Pacific 
and North American plates converge and a new boundary 
called the San Andreas Fault forms. Here, North America moves to the south, sliding against the Pacific Plate,
which shifts to the north. This plate boundary still exists today, and moves about 30 millimeters per year capable of causing 
devastating earthquakes. The San Andreas also pulls apart
western North America across a wide rift zone. This extensional region is called
the Basin and Range Province, and through uplift and erosion, is responsible for exposing the once deep
granite of Yosemite and the Sierra Nevada. Another 15 million years off the clock, and magma from the mantle burns
a giant hole into western North America, periodically erupting onto the surface. Today, this hotspot feeds 
an active supervolcano beneath Yellowstone National Park. It hasn't erupted 
in the last 174,000 years, but if it did, its sheer force could blanket
most of the continent with ash that would blacken the skies
and threaten humanity. The Yellowstone supervolcano
is just one reminder that the Earth continues 
to seethe below our feet. Its mobile plates put the planet
in a state of constant flux. In another few hundred million years, who knows how the landscape
of North America will have changed. As the continent slowly morphs
into something unfamiliar, only geological time will tell."
27,spTWwqVP_2s,The threat of invasive species - Jennifer Klos,"Massive vines that blanket
the southern United States, climbing as high as 100 feet as they
uproot trees and swallow buildings. A ravenous snake that is capable of
devouring an alligator. Rabbit populations that eat
themselves into starvation. These aren't horror movie concepts. They're real stories, but how could such situations
exist in nature? All three are examples
of invasive species, organisms harmful not because
of what they are, but where they happen to be. The kudzu vine, for example, had grown quality in its native east Asia,
eaten by various insects and dying off during the cold winters. But its fortunes changed when it was imported 
into the southeastern United States for porch decoration and cattle feed. Its planting was even subsidized
by the government to fight soil erosion. With sunny fields, a mild climate,
and no natural predators in its new home, the vine grew uncontrollably until it became known as the plant
that ate the South. Meanwhile in Florida's Everglades,
Burmese pythons, thought to have been released
by pet owners, are the cause of decreasing populations
of organisms. They're successfully outcompeting
top predators, such as the alligator and panther, causing a significant reduction
in their food sources. They're not a problem
in their native Asia because diseases, parasites, and predators
help to control their population size. And in Australia, European rabbits
eat so many plants that they wipe out the food supply
for themselves and other herbivores. They're a pretty recent addition, intentionally introduced to the continent
because one man enjoyed hunting them. Like the Burmese pythons, various factors in their native habitat
keep their numbers in control. But in Australia, the lack of predators and a climate perfect 
for year-long reproduction allows their populations to skyrocket. So why does this keep happening? Most of the world's ecosystems are the result of millennia 
of coevolution by organisms, adapting to their environment 
and each other until a stable balance is reached. Healthy ecosystems maintain this balance
via limiting factors, environmental conditions that restrict
the size or range of a species. These include things 
like natural geography and climate, food availability, and the presence or absence of predators. For example, plant growth depends
on levels of sunlight and soil nutrients. The amount of edible plants affects
the population of herbivores, which in turn impacts the carnivores
that feed on them. And a healthy predator population keeps
the herbivores from becoming too numerous and devouring all the plants. But even minor changes in one factor
can upset this balance, and the sudden introduction
of non-native organisms can be a pretty major change. A species that is evolved
in a separate habitat will be susceptible to different 
limiting factors, different predators, different energy sources, and different climates. If the new habitat's limiting factors
fail to restrict the species growth, it will continue to multiply, out-competing native organisms
for resources and disrupting the entire ecosystem. Species are sometimes introduced
into new habitats through natural factors, like storms, ocean currents, or climate shifts. The majority of invasive species,
though, are introduced by humans. Often this happens unintentionally, as when the zebra mussel was accidentally
brought to Lake Erie by cargo ships. But as people migrate around the world, we have also deliberately brought
our plants and animals along, rarely considering the consequences. But now that we're learning more about the effects of invasive species
on ecosystems, many governments closely monitor
the transport of plants and animals, and ban the imports of certain organisms. But could the species with
the most drastic environmental impact be a group of primates who emerged
from Africa to cover most of the world? Are we an invasive species?"
28,xOXSqy05EO0,Can plants talk to each other? - Richard Karban,"Can plants talk to each other? It certainly doesn't seem that way. Plants don't have complex sensory
or nervous systems like animals do, and they look pretty passive, basking in the sun, and responding instinctively
to inputs like light and water. But odd as it sounds, 
plants can communicate with each other. Just like animals, plants produce 
all kinds of chemical signals in response to their environments, and they can share those signals
with each other, especially when they're under attack. These signals take two routes: through the air, and through the soil. When plant leaves get damaged, whether by hungry insects
or an invading lawn mower, they release plumes
of volatile chemicals. They're what's responsible for the smell
of freshly cut grass. Certain kinds of plants, 
like sagebrush and lima beans, are able to pick up on those
airborne messages and adjust their 
own internal chemistry accordingly. In one experiment, sagebrush leaves
were deliberately damaged by insects or scissor-wielding scientists. Throughout the summer, other branches on the same sagebrush plant got eaten less 
by insects wandering through, and so did branches on neighboring bushes, suggesting that they had beefed up
their anti-insect defenses. Even moving the air from above
a clipped plant to another one made the second plant 
more insect-resistant. These airborne cues increase 
the likelihood of seedling survival, and made adult plants produce
more new branches and flowers. But why would a plant warn
its neighbors of danger, especially if they're competing 
for resources? Well, it might be an accidental 
consequence of a self-defense mechanism. Plants can't move information through
their bodies as easily as we can, especially if water is scarce. So plants may rely 
on those airborne chemicals to get messages from 
one part of a plant to another. Nearby plants can eavesdrop 
on those signals, like overhearing your neighbor sneeze
and stocking up on cold medicine. Different plants convey those warnings
using different chemical languages. Individual sagebrush plants 
in the same meadow release slightly different sets
of alarm chemicals. The makeup of that cocktail influences
the effectiveness of communication. The more similar 
two plants' chemical fingerprints are, the more fluently they can communicate. A plant will be most sensitive to the cues
emitted by its own leaves. But because these chemicals seem
to be inherited, like human blood types, sagebrush plants communicate 
more effectively with relatives than with strangers. But sometimes, even other species
can benefit. Tomato and tobacco plants can both
decipher sagebrush warning signals. Plants don't have to rely solely
on those airborne broadcasts. Signals can travel 
below the soil surface, too. Most plants have a symbiotic relationship
with fungi, which colonize the plants' roots
and help them absorb water and nutrients. These fungal filaments 
form extensive networks that can connect separate plants, creating an underground super highway
for chemical messages. When a tomato plant responds to blight by acitvating disease-fighting 
genes and enzymes, signaling molecules produced
by its immune system can travel to a healthy plant and prompt it to turn on
its immune system, too. These advance warnings increase
the plants chance of survival. Bean plants also eavesdrop
on each other's health through these fungal conduits. An aphid investation in one plant triggers its neighbor to ramp up
production of compounds that repel aphids and attract aphid-eating wasps. If you think of communication
as an exchange of information, then plants seem to be 
active communicators. They're sending, receiving, 
and responding to signals without making a sound, and without brains, noses, dictionaries,
or the Internet. And if we can learn to speak to them
on their terms, we may gain a powerful new tool to protect
crops and other valuable species. It all makes you wonder 
what else are we missing?"
29,sI8NsYIyQ2A,Why do cats act so weird? - Tony Buffington,"Why do cats do that? They're cute, they're lovable, and judging by the 26 billions views
of over 2 million YouTube videos of them pouncing, bouncing, climbing, cramming, stalking, clawing, chattering, and purring, one thing is certain: cats are very entertaining. These somewhat strange feline behaviors, both amusing and baffling, leave many of us asking,
""Why do cats do that?"" Throughout time, cats were simultaneously
solitary predators of smaller animals and prey for larger carnivores. As both predator and prey, survival of their species depended
on crucial instinctual behaviors which we still observe in wild 
and domestic cats today. While the feline actions of your house cat
Grizmo might seem perplexing, in the wild, these same behaviors, naturally bred into cats 
for millions of years, would make Grizmo a super cat. Enabled by their unique muscular structure
and keen balancing abilities, cats climbed to high vantage points
to survey their territory and spot prey in the wild. Grizmo doesn't need these particular
skills to find and hunt down dinner in her food bowl today, but instinctually, viewing the living room
from the top of the bookcase is exactly what she has evolved to do. As wild predators, cats are opportunistic
and hunt whenever prey is available. Since most cat prey are small, cats in the wild needed to eat 
many times each day, and use a stalk, pounce, kill, eat
strategy to stay fed. This is why Grizmo prefers to chase
and pounce on little toys and eat small meals over the course
of the day and night. Also, small prey tend to hide in tiny
spaces in their natural environments, so one explanation for Grizmo's propensity
to reach into containers and openings is that she is compelled by 
the same curiosity that helped ensure the continuation of
her species for millions of years before. In the wild, cats needed sharp claws
for climbing, hunting, and self-defense. Sharpening their claws on nearby surfaces
kept them conditioned and ready, helped stretch their back and leg muscles, and relieve some stress, too. So, it's not that Grizmo hates your couch, chair, ottoman, pillows, curtains, and everything else 
you put in her environment. She's ripping these things to shreds
and keeping her claws in tip-top shape because this is exactly what her ancestors
did in order to survive. As animals that were preyed upon, cats evolved to not get caught, and in the wild, the cats that were 
the best at avoiding predators thrived. So at your house today, Grizmo is an expert 
at squeezing into small spaces and seeking out and hiding
in unconventional spots. It also explains why she prefers
a clean and odor-free litter box. That's less likely to give away 
her location to any predators that may be sniffing around nearby. Considering everything 
we do know about cats, it seems that one of their most 
predominate behaviors is still one of the most mysterious. Cats may purr for any number of reasons, such as happiness, stress, and hunger. But curiously, 
the frequency of their purrs, between 25 and 150 hertz, is within a range that can promote
tissue regeneration. So while her purring makes Grizmo
an excellent nap companion, it is also possible that her purr
is healing her muscles and bones, and maybe even yours, too. They developed through time as both solitary predators 
that hunted and killed to eat, and stealthy prey that hid
and escaped to survive. So cats today retain many 
of the same instincts that allowed them to thrive in the wild
for millions of years. This explains some of their seemingly
strange behaviors. To them, our homes are their jungles. But if this is the case, 
in our own cat's eyes, who are we? Big, dumb, hairless cats competing with
them for resources? Terribly stupid predators they're able
to outsmart every day? Or maybe they think we're the prey."
30,uy9GFAOGGXU,Why is Mount Everest so tall? - Michele Koppes,"Every spring, hundreds of adventure-seekers dream
of climbing Qomolangma, also known as Mount Everest. At base camp, they hunker down for months waiting for the chance to scale 
the mountain's lofty, lethal peak. But why do people risk life and limb
to climb Everest? Is it the challenge? The view? The chance to touch the sky? For many, the draw is Everest's status
as the highest mountain on Earth. There's an important distinction
to make here. Mauna Kea is actually the tallest
from base to summit, but at 8850 meters above sea level, Everest has the highest altitude 
on the planet. To understand how 
this towering formation was born, we have to peer deep 
into our planet's crust, where continental plates collide. The Earth's surface 
is like an armadillo's armor. Pieces of crust constantly move over, under, and around each other. For such huge continental plates,
the motion is relatively quick. They move two to four 
centimeters per year, about as fast as fingernails grow. When two plates collide, one pushes into or underneath the other,
buckling at the margins, and causing what's known as uplift
to accomodate the extra crust. That's how Everest came about. 50 million years ago, the Earth's 
Indian Plate drifted north, bumped into the bigger Eurasian Plate, and the crust crumpled,
creating huge uplift. Mountain Everest lies at the heart
of this action, on the edge of the Indian-Eurasian 
collision zone. But mountains are shaped by forces
other than uplift. As the land is pushed up, 
air masses are forced to rise as well. Rising air cools, causing any water
vapor within it to condense and form rain or snow. As that falls, 
it wears down the landscape, dissolving rocks or breaking them down
in a process known as weathering. Water moving downhill carries
the weathered material and erodes the landscape, carving out deep valleys and jagged peaks. This balance between uplift and erosion
gives a mountain its shape. But compare the celestial peaks
of the Himalayas to the comforting hills of Appalachia. Clearly, all mountains are not alike. That's because time 
comes into the equation, too. When continental plates first collide,
uplift happens fast. The peaks grow tall with steep slopes. Over time, however, gravity and water
wear them down. Eventually, erosion overtakes uplift, wearing down peaks 
faster than they're pushed up. A third factor shapes mountains: climate. In subzero temperatures, some snowfall
doesn't completely melt away, instead slowly compacting 
until it becomes ice. That forms the snowline, which occurs
at different heights around the planet depending on climate. At the freezing poles,
the snowline is at sea level. Near the equator, you have to climb
five kilometers before it gets cold enough for ice to form. Gathered ice starts flowing under
its own immense weight forming a slow-moving frozen river
known as a glacier, which grinds the rocks below. The steeper the mountains, 
the faster ice flows, and the quicker it carves 
the underlying rock. Glaciers can erode landscapes
swifter than rain and rivers. Where glaciers cling to mountain peaks,
they sand them down so fast, they lop the tops off
like giant snowy buzzsaws. So then, how did the icy Mount Everest
come to be so tall? The cataclysmic continental clash
from which it arose made it huge to begin with. Secondly, the mountain lies 
near the tropics, so the snowline is high,
and the glaciers relatively small, barely big enough to widdle it down. The mountain exists in a perfect storm
of conditions that maintain its impressive stature. But that won't always be the case. We live in a changing world 
where the continental plates, Earth's climate, and the planet's erosive power might one day conspire to cut 
Mount Everest down to size. For now, at least, it remains legendary
in the minds of hikers, adventurers, and dreamers alike."
31,dkP8NUwB2io,How do schools of fish swim in harmony? - Nathan S. Jacobs,"How do schools of fish swim in harmony? And how do the tiny cells in your brain
give rise to the complex thoughts, memories, and consciousness that are you? Oddly enough, those questions have
the same general answer: emergence, or the spontaneous creation of
sophisticated behaviors and functions from large groups of simple elements. Like many animals, 
fish stick together in groups, but that's not just because
they enjoy each other's company. It's a matter of survival. Schools of fish exhibit 
complex swarming behaviors that help them evade hungry predators, while a lone fish is quickly singled out
as easy prey. So which brilliant fish leader
is the one in charge? Actually, no one is, and everyone is. So what does that mean? While the school of fish is elegantly
twisting, turning, and dodging sharks in what looks 
like deliberate coordination, each individual fish is actually
just following two basic rules that have nothing to do with the shark: one, stay close, but not too close
to your neighbor, and two, keep swimmming. As individuals, the fish are focused on
the minutiae of these local interactions, but if enough fish join the group,
something remarkable happens. The movement of individual fish 
is eclipsed by an entirely new entity: the school, which has its own
unique set of behaviors. The school isn't controlled
by any single fish. It simply emerges if you have enough fish
following the right set of local rules. It's like an accident that happens over
and over again, allowing fish all across the ocean
to reliably avoid predation. And it's not just fish. Emergence is a basic property of many
complex systems of interacting elements. For example, the specific way in which
millions of grains of sand collide and tumble over each other almost always produces the same
basic pattern of ripples. And when moisture freezes
in the atmosphere, the specific binding properties
of water molecules reliably produce radiating lattices
that form into beautiful snowflakes. What makes emergence so complex is that you can't understand it
by simply taking it apart, like the engine of a car. Taking things apart is a good first step
to understanding a complex system. But if you reduce a school of fish
to individuals, it loses the ability to evade predators, and there's nothing left to study. And if you reduce the brain 
to individual neurons, you're left with something that is
notoriously unreliable, and nothing like how we think and behave, at least most of the time. Regardless, whatever you're thinking about
right now isn't reliant on a single neuron
lodged in the corner of your brain. Rather, the mind emerges from
the collective activities of many, many neurons. There are billions of neurons 
in the human brain, and trillions of connections between
all those neurons. When you turn such a complicated
system like that on, it could behave in all sorts
of weird ways, but it doesn't. The neurons in our brain follow
simple rules, just like the fish, so that as a group, their activity
self-organizes into reliable patterns that let you do things 
like recognize faces, successfully repeat the same task
over and over again, and keep all those silly little habits
that everyone likes about you. So, what are the simple rules 
when it comes to the brain? The basic function of each neuron
in the brain is to either excite or inhibit
other neurons. If you connect a few neurons together
into a simple circuit, you can generate rhythmic patterns
of activity, feedback loops that ramp up
or shut down a signal, coincidence detectors, and disinhibition, where two inhibitory neurons
can actually activate another neuron by removing inhibitory brakes. As more and more neurons are connected, increasingly complex patterns 
of activity emerge from the network. Soon, so many neurons are interacting
in so many different ways at once that the system becomes chaotic. The trajectory of the network's activity
cannot be easily explained by the simple local circuits
described earlier. And yet, from this chaos,
patterns can emerge, and then emerge again and again
in a reproducible manner. At some point, these emergent
patterns of activity become sufficiently complex, and curious to begin studying
their own biological origins, not to mention emergence. And what we found in emergent phenomena
at vastly different scales is that same remarkable
characteristic as the fish displayed: That emergence doesn't require
someone or something to be in charge. If the right rules are in place, and some basic conditions are met, a complex system will fall into
the same habits over and over again, turning chaos into order. That's true in the molecular pandemonium
that lets your cells function, the tangled thicket of neurons
that produces your thoughts and identity, your network of friends and family, all the way up to the structures and
economies of our cities across the planet."
32,2ivZ6GSaK1M,Why are there so many insects? - Murry Gans,"If insects suddenly morphed
into large beings, and decided to wage war on us, there's no doubt that humans
would lose. We'd simply be crushed 
by their sheer numbers. There are an estimated 10 quintillion
individual insects on Earth. That's a one followed by 19 zeroes. So, compared with our population
of about 7 billion, these invertebrates outnumber
us by more than a billion to one. Their astounding numbers exist
at the species level, as well. There are more than 60,000
vertebrate species on the planet. But the class of insects contains
a million known species, and many others 
that haven't been classified. In fact, these critters make up 
approximately 75% of all animals on Earth. So, what's their secret to success? Insect abundance comes down
to many things that together make them some of the most
adaptable and resilient creatures, beginning with their impressive 
ability to breed. Many species can produce hundreds
of offspring within their lifetimes. Most offspring will die, but more than enough will survive
into adulthood to reproduce. Offspring also mature very rapidly, so the cycle of reproduction
resumes quickly, and can occur over and over again
in a short time. These numbers mean that as a class, insects harbor a tremendous amount
of genetic diversity. The different species contain
a wealth of genetic data that give them the necessary adaptations
they need to thrive in a range of environments
across the planet. Even some of the most extreme
environments are in bounds; Flat bark beetles can live at
-40 degrees Fahrenheit, Sahara Desert ants can venture out when surface temperatures exceed
155 degrees, and some bumblebees can survive
18,000 feet above sea level. Insect exoskeletons also work
like body armor, protecting insects against
the outside world and helping them cope with habitats
that other creatures can't. Even their small size, which we might see as a disadvantage, is something they use to their benefit. Because most species are so tiny, millions of insects can inhabit
a small space and make use of all the available
resources within it. This means they can occupy hundreds
of different niches across ecosystems. Some insects survive by eating the roots, stems, leaves, seeds, pollen, and nectar of specific plants. Others, like wasps, make use of live insects 
by paralyzing the victims and laying their eggs inside so that when the hatchlings emerge, they can eat their way out
and get nourishment. Mosquitos and biting flies feed on blood, taking advantage of this unusual resource
to ensure their survival. And a whole bunch of other insects
have built a niche around feces. Flies lay their eggs there, and some beetles even build
large balls out of animal dung, which they eat and use as accommodation
for their eggs. And then there's the insects' mighty power
of metamorphosis. This trait not only transforms insects, but also helps them maximize
the available resources in an ecosystem. Take butterflies. In their larval caterpillar form, they chomp hungrily through leaves
at a rapid rate to help them grow and spin cocoons. But when they emerge as butterflies, these insects feed only on flower nectar. Metamorphosis means the larvae
and adults of one species will never compete for the same resource, so they successfully share 
an ecological niche without limiting their own success. This process is so efficient that an incredible 86% of insect species
undergo complete metamorphosis. We're big and they're small, so it's easy to forget that these critters
are moving in their millions all around us, all the time. But examine almost any patch of ground, and you're sure to find them there. Their numbers are immense,
and their success is unmatched. We may have to accept 
that it's insects, not us, that are the true conquerors 
of the planet."
33,cNVZEVq3KzY,Why certain naturally occurring wildfires are necessary - Jim Schulz,"There was a time before our ancestors
smashed flint and steel together, when they felt the cold 
lack of fire in their lives. But anthropologists theorize 
that early hominids relied on lightning to cause forest fires, from which they could collect coals
and burning sticks. Fire gave them the ability to cook food
and clear land, and became central in many rituals
and traditions. So instead of seeing forest fires
as an exclusively bad thing, ancient humans may have learned
to appreciate them. Yet, it wasn't just humans who
benefitted from these natural phenomena. Even as they destroy trees,
fires also help the forest themselves, however counterintuitive that seems. In fact, several forest species,
such as select conifers, need fire to survive. But how can fire possibly create life
in addition to destroying it? The answer lies in the way
that certain forests grow. In the conifer-rich forests 
of western North America, lodgepole pines constantly seek the Sun. Their seeds prefer to grow 
on open sunny ground, which pits saplings against each other
as each tries to get more light by growing straighter and faster
than its neighbors. Over time, generations of slender,
lofty lodgepoles form an umbrella-like canopy
that shades the forest floor below. But as the trees' pine cones mature
to release their twirling seeds, this signals a problem
for the lodgepoles' future. Very few of these seeds will germintate
in the cool, sunless shade created by their towering parents. These trees have adapted to this problem
by growing two types of cones. There are the regular annual cones
that release seeds spontaneously, and another type called serotinous cones, which need an environmental trigger
to free their seeds. Serotinous cones 
are produced in thousands, and are like waterproofed time capsules
sealed with resinous pitch. Many are able to stay undamaged
on the tree for decades. Cones that fall to the ground
can be viable for several years, as well. But when temperatures get high enough,
the cones pop open. Let's see that in action. Once it's gotten started,
a coniferous forest fire typically spreads something like this. Flames ravage the thick understory
provided by species like douglas fir, a shade-tolerant tree 
that's able to thrive under the canopy 
of lodgepole pines. The fire uses these smaller trees
as a step ladder to reach the higher canopy 
of old lodgepole pines. That ignites a tremendous crown fire reaching temperatures 
of up to 2400 degrees Fahrenheit. That's well more than the 115-140 degrees that signal the moment 
when serotinous seeds can be freed. At those temperatures,
the cones burst open, releasing millions of seeds, which are carried by the hot air
to form new forests. After the fire, carbon-rich soils
and an open sunlit landscape help lodgepole seeds germinate quickly
and sprout in abundance. From the death of the old forest
comes the birth of the new. Fires are also important
for the wider ecosystem as a whole. Without wildfires to rejuvenate trees,
key forest species would disappear, and so would the many creatures
that depend on them. And if a fire-dependent forest
goes too long without burning, that raises the risk 
of a catastrophic blaze, which could destroy a forest completely, not to mention people's homes and lives. That's why forest rangers sometimes
intentionally start controlled burns to reduce fuels in order to keep
the more dangerous wildfires at bay. They may be frightening
and destructive forces of nature, but wildfires are also vital to the existence of healthy 
boreal forest ecosystems. By coming to terms with that, we can protect ourselves from their
more damaging effects while enabling the forests,
like the legendary phoenix, to rise reborn from their own ashes."
34,doy2BsHc-44,The most lightning-struck place on Earth - Graeme Anderson,"The epic poem ""La Dragontea"" describes how English explorer
Sir Francis Drake sailed across 
the Gulf of Venezuela in 1595. He was aiming for 
the nearby Lake Maracaibo, home to a colony of Spanish settlers
he planned to overthrow. But as Drake moved towards the mouth
of the lake under cover of darkness, his plot was suddenly 
and magnificently foiled. Huge flashes of lightning 
illuminated the landscape, exposing the fleet as if it were daytime, which warned the Spanish 
about his approach. Lake Maracaibo is 
the stormiest place on the planet. The massive body of water
at over 13,000 square kilometers is a place of almost perpetual storming. Thunderstorms rage above it
for up to 200 days of the year, each earsplitting event lasting
for several hours. Like everywhere else on Earth, lightning at Lake Maracaibo is the result
of opposing electrical charges that steadily build up 
inside storm clouds. Once there's a large enough difference
between charges either within the cloud or between the clouds
and the Earth below, it forms a spark that becomes
a lightning bolt. Lightning strikes the earth
about 350 million times per year, averaging out to eleven strikes a second. We know that thanks to satellites
up in space and sensors on the ground. We can also measure 
the Earth's lightning density, which is the frequency with which
lightning flashes in a square kilometer. Knowing where lightning strikes
and how often reveals the most 
lightning-rich places on Earth. In the polar regions, there may only be one strike
per several square kilometers each year. Meanwhile, lightning density 
at the equator averages out to tens of flashes
per square kilometer on account of the sun providing
more heat to drive storms. Yet nowhere can quite compare
with Lake Maracaibo, where lightning strikes an average
250 times per square kilometer, giving it the highest lightning density
of any place on Earth. A number of factors converge to create
the lake's seemingly everlasting storms. Firstly, Lake Maracaibo lies just 
ten degrees north of the Equator, so there's a wealth of solar energy
available to fuel the storms. Thunderstorms also require a supply
of water vapor to feed on, and having the warm waters
of the Caribbean so close by provides an endless supply. Finally, the lake's southern 
and western edges are bordered by two massive 
mountain ranges, and as cool winds surge
down these slopes, they force up warm air, destabilizing the atmosphere
and causing storm clouds to form. Together, these ingredients combine to give rise to the most awe-inspiring
thunderstorms on the planet, a true sight to behold. Centuries ago, Sir Francis Drake may have
cursed the lake's intense illumination, but today, sailors actually embrace
this phenomenon. They call it the Maracaibo Beacon, and use it as a natural lighthouse
to illuminate their path across the seas."
35,RAdNCIIYXvo,"When will the next mass extinction occur? - Borths, D'Emic, and Pritchard","About 66 million years ago, something terrible happened
to life on our planet. Ecosystems were hit with a double blow as massive volcanic eruptions filled
the atmosphere with carbon dioxide and an asteroid roughly the size
of Manhattan struck the Earth. The dust from the impact reduced or
stopped photosynthesis from many plants, starving herbivores and the carnivores
that preyed on them. Within a short time span, three-quarters of the world's species
disappeared forever, and the giant dinosaurs, flying pterosaurs, shelled squids, and marine reptiles 
that had flourished for ages faded into prehistory. It may seem like the dinosaurs
were especially unlucky, but extinctions of various severities have
occurred throughout the Earth's history, and are still happening 
all around us today. Environments change, pushing some species 
out of their comfort zones while creating new opportunities
for others. Invasive species arrive in new habitats,
outcompeting the natives. And in some cases, 
entire species are wiped out as a result of activity 
by better adapted organisms. Sometimes, however, massive changes
in the environment occur too quickly 
for most living creatures to adapt, causing thousands of species to die off
in a geological instant. We call this a mass extinction event, and although such events may be rare, paleontologists have been able 
to identify several of them through dramatic changes 
in the fossil record, where lineages that persisted
through several geological layers suddenly disappear. In fact, these mass extinctions are used
to divide the Earth's history into distinct periods. Although the disappearance 
of the dinosaurs is the best known mass extinction event, the largest occurred long before
dinosaurs ever existed. 252 million years ago,
between the Permian and Triassic periods, the Earth's land masses gathered together
into the single supercontinent Pangaea. As it coalesced, 
its interior was filled with deserts, while the single coastline eliminated
many of the shallow tropical seas where biodiversity thrived. Huge volcanic eruptions 
occurred across Siberia, coinciding with very high temperatures, suggesting a massive greenhouse effect. These catastrophes 
contributed to the extinction of 95% of species in the ocean, and on land, the strange 
reptiles of the Permian gave way to the ancestors of the 
far more familiar dinosaurs we know today. But mass extinctions are not just a thing
of the distant past. Over the last few million years, the fluctuation of massive ice sheets
at our planet's poles has caused sea levels to rise and fall, changing weather patterns
and ocean currents along the way. As the ice sheets spread, 
retreated, and returned, some animals were either 
able to adapt to the changes, or migrate to a more suitable environment. Others, however, 
such as giant ground sloths, giant hyenas, and mammoths went extinct. The extinction of these large mammals coincides with changes in the climate
and ecosystem due to the melting ice caps. But there is also 
an uncomfortable overlap with the rise of a certain hominid species
originating in Africa 150,000 years ago. In the course of their adaptation
to the new environment, creating new tools and methods
for gathering food and hunting prey, humans may not have single-handedly caused
the extinction of these large animals, as some were able to coexist with us
for thousands of years. But it's clear that today, our tools and methods 
have become so effective that humans are no longer reacting
to the environment, but are actively changing it. The extinction of species 
is a normal occurrence in the background of ecosystems. But studies suggest 
that rates of extinction today for many organisms are hundreds to thousands of times higher
than the normal background. But the same unique ability that makes
humans capable of driving mass extinctions can also enable us to prevent them. By learning about past extinction events, recognizing what is happening today
as environments change, and using this knowledge to lessen
our effect on other species, we can transform humanity's impact
on the world from something as destructive
as a massive asteroid into a collaborative part
of a biologically diverse future."
36,qYijAZWdnBk,How do we know what color dinosaurs were? - Len Bloch,"This is the microraptor, a carnivorous four-winged dinosaur
that was almost two-feet long, ate fish, and lived about 120 million years ago. Most of what we know about it
comes from fossils that look like this. So, is its coloration here 
just an artist's best guess? The answer is no. We know this shimmering 
black color is accurate because paleontologists have analyzed
clues contained within the fossil. But making sense of the evidence
requires careful examination of the fossil and a good understanding of the physics
of light and color. First of all, here's what we actually see
on the fossil: imprints of bones and feathers that have
left telltale mineral deposits. And from those imprints, we can determine that these 
microraptor feathers were similar to modern dinosaur,
as in bird, feathers. But what gives birds their signature
diverse colorations? Most feathers contain just one
or two dye-like pigments. The cardinal's bright red
comes from carotenoids, the same pigments 
that make carrots orange, while the black of its face
is from melanin, the pigment that colors our hair and skin. But in bird feathers,
melanin isn't simply a dye. It forms hollow nanostructures
called melanosomes which can shine in all the colors
of the rainbow. To understand how that works, it helps to remember 
some things about light. Light is basically a tiny electromagnetic
wave traveling through space. The top of a wave is called its crest and the distance between two crests
is called the wavelength. The crests in red light are about
700 billionths of a meter apart and the wavelength of purple light
is even shorter, about 400 billionths of a meter,
or 400 nanometers. When light hits the thin front surface
of a bird's hollow melanosome, some is reflected and some passes through. A portion of the transmitted light
then reflects off the back surface. The two reflected waves interact. Usually they cancel each other out, but when the wavelength
of the reflected light matches the distance between
the two reflections, they reinforce each other. Green light has a wavelength
of about 500 nanometers, so melanosomes that are 
about 500 nanometers across give off green light, thinner melanosomes give off purple light, and thicker ones give off red light. Of course, it's more complex than this. The melanosomes are packed together
inside cells, and other factors, like how the melanosomes are arranged 
within the feather, also matter. Let's return to the microraptor fossil. When scientists examined its feather 
imprints under a powerful microscope, they found nanostructures 
that look like melanosomes. X-ray analysis of the melanosomes
further supported that theory. They contained minerals that would
result from the decay of melanin. The scientists then chose 20 feathers
from one fossil and found that 
the melanosomes in all 20 looked alike, so they became pretty sure this dinosaur
was one solid color. They compared these microraptor
melanosomes to those of modern birds and found a close similarity,
though not a perfect match, to the iridescent teal feathers
found on duck wings. And by examining the exact size
and arrangement of the melanosomes, scientists determined that the feathers
were iridescent black. Now that we can determine
a fossilized feather's color, paleontologists are looking for more
fossils with well-preserved melanosomes. They've found that a lot of dinosaurs,
including velociraptor, probably had feathers, meaning that certain films might not be
so biologically accurate. Clever girls."
37,FwGH4gulLX4,The science of snowflakes - Maruša Bradač,"If you ever find yourself 
gazing at falling snow, why not catch a few snowflakes 
on your glove and examine their shapes? You might notice 
that they look symmetrical, and if you look closely, you'll see they have six sides. You could say a snowflake 
is simply frozen water, but compare one 
with an ice cube from the freezer, and you'll realize 
they're very different things. Unlike ice cubes, formed when liquid
freezes into a solid, snowflakes form when water vapor
turns straight into ice. But that still doesn't explain why
snowflakes have six sides. To understand that, we need to delve deeper 
into the physics of water. Water is made out of two hydrogen atoms
and one oxygen atom. A single water molecule 
thus has ten protons and ten electrons, eight from oxygen 
and one from each hydrogen atom. The two electrons 
from oxygen's outer shell are shared with two electrons
from both hydrogens as they bond together, and the remaining 
four outer shell electrons from oxygen form two pairs. We call the bonds between these atoms
covalent bonds. The pairs of electrons 
are all negatively charged. Similar charges repel, so they tend to stay as far away
from each other as possible. The pairs form four electron clouds, two of which are where the hydrogen
and oxygen share electrons. The repulsion between the unbonded pairs is even stronger than repulsion
between the shared pairs, so the two hydrogens 
get pushed a little further to an angle of 104.5 degrees. The water molecule as a whole
is electrically neutral, but oxygen gets 
a larger share of electrons, making it slightly negative
and the hydrogens slightly positive. Due to its negative charge, the oxygen in one molecule is attracted to the positive charge
of the hydrogen in another molecule. And so a weak bond 
between the two molecules, called a hydrogen bond,
is formed. When water freezes, this bonding
occurs on repeat, ultimately forming a hexagonal structure due to the angle between hydrogens
and oxygen within each molecule. This is the seed of a snowflake, and it retains a hexagonal shape
as it grows. As the snowflake moves through the air, water vapor molecules 
stick to the six sharp edges and expand the snowflake outwards,
bit by bit. A snowflake's developing shape depends
on atmospheric conditions, like humidity and temperature. As a snowflake falls, changes in weather conditions
can affect how it grows, and even small differences in the paths
two snowflakes take will differentiate their shapes. However, since conditions at the six 
sharp edges of one snowflake are similar, a symmetric snowflake can grow. Weather conditions 
affect snow on the ground, as well. Warmer ground temperatures produce
a wetter snow that is easier to pack because liquid water molecules
help snowflakes stick to each other. Melted snow also plays a critical role
in another wintry activity, skiing. Completely dry snow 
is very difficult to ski on because there's too much friction between
the jagged snowflakes and the ski surface. So what's happening is that as skis move, they rub the surface of the snow
and warm it up, creating a thin layer of water,
which helps them slide along. So technically, 
it's not really snow skiing, but water skiing. But it is true that 
no matter how hard you look, you're almost definitely not going to find
two identical snowflakes, and that's a mystery that scientists
are still trying to solve, though we know that it has to do with the many possible 
branching points in snowflake formation, and the differences 
in temperature and humidity, and while we wait for the answer, we can enjoy watching these tiny fractals
falling from the sky."
38,_1FY5kL_zXU,Do animals have language? - Michele Bishop,"All animals communicate. Crabs wave their claws at each other
to signal that they're healthy and ready to mate. Cuttlefish use pigmented skin cells
called chromatophores to create patterns on their skin
that act as camouflage or warnings to rivals. Honeybees perform complex dances to let other bees know the location
and quality of a food source. All of these animals have impressive
communication systems, but do they have language? To answer that question, we can look at four specific qualities
that are often associated with language: discreteness, grammar, productivity, and displacement. Discreteness means that there is a set
of individual units, such as sounds or words, that can be combined
to communicate new ideas, like a set of refrigerator poetry magnets
you can rearrange to create different phrases. Grammar provides a system of rules that tells you how to combine 
those individual units. Productivity is the ability 
to use language to create an infinite number of messages. And displacement is the ability 
to talk about things that aren't right in front of you, such as past, future, or fictional events. So, does animal communication exhibit 
any of these qualities? For crabs and cuttlefish, 
the answer is no. They don't combine their signals 
in creative ways. Those signals also don't have to be 
in a grammatical order, and they only communicate 
current conditions, like, ""I am healthy,"" 
or ""I am poisonous."" But some animals actually do display
some of these properties. Bees use the moves, angle, duration,
and intensity of their waggle dance to describe the location and richness
of a food source. That source is outside the hive, so they exhibit the property 
of displacement. They share that language trait
with prairie dogs, which live in towns of thousands, and are hunted by coyotes, hawks,
badgers, snakes, and humans. Their alarms calls indicate
the predator's size, shape, speed, and, even for human predators,
what the person is wearing and if he's carrying a gun. Great apes, like chimps and gorillas,
are great communicators, too. Some have even learned 
a modified sign language. A chimpanzee named Washoe
demonstrated discreteness by combining multiple signs
into original phrases, like, ""Please open. Hurry."" Coco, a female gorilla who understands
more than 1000 signs, and around 2000 words of spoken English referred to a beloved kitten 
that had died. In doing so, she displayed displacement, though it's worth noting that the apes
in both of these examples were using a human communication system, not one that appeared 
naturally in the wild. There are many other examples
of sophisticated animal communication, such as in dolphins, which use whistles to identify age, 
location, names, and gender. They can also understand some grammar in a gestural language researchers use
to communicate with them. However, grammar is not seen 
in the dolphin's natural communication. While these communication systems may have some of the qualities 
of language we've identified, none display all four. Even Washoe and Coco's impressive 
abilities are still outpaced by the language skills 
of most three-year-old humans. And animals' topics of conversation
are usually limited. Bees talk about food, prairie dogs talk about predators, and crabs talk about themselves. Human language stands alone due to the powerful combination
of grammar and productivity, on top of discreteness and displacement. The human brain can take 
a finite number of elements and create an infinite number of messages. We can craft and understand 
complex sentences, as well as words that have never
been spoken before. We can use language to communicate
about an endless range of subjects, talk about imaginary things, and even lie. Research continues to reveal more
and more about animal communication. It may turn out that human language
and animal communication aren't entirely different
but exist on a continuum. After all, we are all animals."
39,05PpTqtGhGU,How smart are dolphins? - Lori Marino,"In 1985, three researchers on 
a dolphin-studying expedition got a little bored. To lighten things up, one pretended
to be Poseidon by placing a seaweed garland on his head
and then throwing it into the ocean. Moments later, a dolphin surfaced
with the seaweed crowning her head. Sure, this could have been a coincidence, but it's also entirely possible that
the dolphin was mimicking the scientist. That's because dolphins are one
of the smartest animals species on Earth. So exactly how smart are they? Like whales and porpoises, dolphins belong to the group
of aquatic mammals known as cetaceans
who comprise 86 different species, and share a common link with ungulates,
or hoofed animals. Originally land mammals, the first cetaceans entered the water
about 55 million years ago as large predators with sharp teeth. Then, a shift in ocean temperatures
about 35 million years ago reduced the availability of prey. One group of cetaceans who survived
this distruption, the odontocetes, wound up smaller
with less sharp teeth, but also larger and more complex brains that allowed for complex 
social relationships, as well as echolocation to navigate
and communicate. Jump ahead to the present, and modern dolphins' brains are so large
that their encephalization quotient, their brain size compared to the average
for their body size, is second only to humans. Dolphins have evolved to survive through their ability to form 
complex social networks that hunt, ward off rivals,
and raise offspring together. For example, one group of Florida dolphins practices a sophisticated form
of cooperation to hunt fish. A dolphin designated 
as ""the net-maker"" kicks up mud while another gives the signal for the other dolphins to simultaneously
line up and catch the escaping fish. Achieving a goal like this requires
deliberate planning and cooperation, which, in turn, requires some form
of intentional communication. Dolphins pass down their communication
methods and other skills from generation to generation. Different dolphin populations exhibit
variations in greetings, hunting strategies,
and other behaviors. This sort of cultural transmission
even extends to tool use. One group of bottlenose dolphins
off the Australian coast nicknamed The Dolphin Sponge Club, has learned how to cover their rostrums
with sponges when rooting in sharp corals, passing the knowledge 
from mother to daughter. Dolphins have even demonstrated
language comprehension. When taught a language based on
whistles and hand gestures, they not only understood
what the signals meant, but that their order had meaning: the difference between 
bringing the ball to the hoop and bringing the hoop to the ball. So they were able to process two
of the main elements of human language: symbols that stand 
for objects and actions, and syntax that governs 
how they are structured. Dolphins are also one of the few species
who pass the mirror test. By recognizing themselves in mirrors,
they indicate physical self-awareness, and research shows they can recognize
not just their bodies, but also their own thoughts,
a property called metacognition. In one study, 
dolphins comparing two sounds could indicate a same, different,
or uncertain response. Just like humans, they indicated uncertainty
more often with difficult trials, suggesting they're aware 
of what they know, and how confident they feel
about that knowledge. But some of the most amazing things
about dolphins are their senses of empathy, altruism,
and attachment. The habit of helping injured individuals
extends across the species barrier as evidenced by the many accounts of dolphins carrying humans
to the surface to breathe. And like us, dolphins mourn their dead. When we consider all the evidence, we may wonder why humans still hunt
dolphins for meat, endanger them through fishing
and pollution, or imprison them to perform tricks. The ultimate question may not be
whether dolphins are intelligent and complex beings, but whether humans can empathize with them
enough to keep them safe and free."
40,PddQvyiBfdc,What happens when continents collide? - Juan D. Carrillo,"Tens of millions of years ago, a force of nature set two giant masses
on an unavoidable collision course that would change the face of the Earth and spell life or death 
for thousands of species. The force of nature was plate tectonics, and the bodies were 
North and South America. And even though 
they were hurdling towards each other at an underwhelming 2.5 cm per year, their collision actually did have massive
biological reprocussions by causing one of the greatest episodes of
biological migration in Earth's history: The Great American Biotic Interchange. Our story begins 65 million years ago,
the beginning of the age of mammals, when what is now North and South America were continents separated 
by a marine connection between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. During this time, South America
was the home of fauna that included armored glyptodonts
as large as compact cars, giant ground sloths
weighing more than a ton, opossums, monkeys,
and carnivorous terror birds. North America had its own species, such as horses, bears,
and saber-toothed cats. Over 20 million years, the shifting
of the Farallon and Caribbean Plates produced the Central America Volcanic Arc,
a peninsula connected to North America, with only a very narrow seaway
separating it from South America. As these plates continued
to surf the Earth's magma layer far beneath the Pacific Ocean floor, the Caribbean Plate migrated eastward, and about 15 million years ago, South America finally collided with 
this Central American Arc. This gradually closed the water connection
between the Pacific and the Caribbean, creating a land bridge, which connected North America 
to South America. Terrestrial organisms could now
cross between the two continents, and from the fossil records, it's evident that different waves
of their dispersals took place. Even though plants don't physically move, they are easily dispersed 
by wind and waves, so they migrated first,
along with a few species of birds. They were followed 
by some freshwater fishes and amphibians, and finally, various mammals
began to traverse the bridge. From South America, mammals like
ground sloths and glyptodonts were widly distributed in North America. Moreover, many South American
tropical mammals, like monkeys and bats,
colonized the forests of Central America, and are very abundant today. South American predator marsupials
went extinct 3 million years ago, at which point North American predators,
such as cats, bears and foxes, migrated south and occupied 
the ecological space left behind. Horses, llamas, tapirs, cougars,
saber-toothed cats, gomphotheres, and later humans also headed
south across the land bridge. But what happened on land
is only half the story. What had been one giant ocean
was now two, creating differences in temperature
and salinity for the two bodies of water. The isthmus also became a barrier
for many marine organisms, like mollusks, crustaceans, foraminifera,
bryozoans, and fish, and separated the populations
of many marine species. It also allowed the establishment
of the thermohaline circulation, a global water conveyor belt, which transports warm water
across the Atlantic, and influences the climate
of the East Coast of North America, the West Coast of Europe,
and many other areas. It's a challenge to track all of the ways the collision of the Americas 
changed the world, but it's safe to say that the ripples
of the Great American Biotic Interchange have propagated through
the history of life on the planet, and that of mankind. What if these species hadn't gone extinct, or if there were no monkeys 
in Central America, or jaguars in South America? What if the thermohaline circulation
wasn't flowing? Would the East Coast of North America
be much colder? It all goes to show some of the most
impactful transformations of our planet aren't the explosive ones
that happen in an instant, but the ones that crawl towards
irreversible change. We are the product of history."
41,Pu_ijC8HFRU,How does a jellyfish sting? - Neosha S Kashef,"You're swimming in the ocean
when something brushes your leg. When the tingling sets in, you realize you've been stung 
by a jellyfish. How do these beautiful, gelatinous
creatures pack such a painful punch? Jellyfish are soft 
because they are 95% water and are mostly made of a translucent 
gel-like substance called mesoglea. With such delicate bodies, they rely on thousands of venom-containing
stinging cells called cnidocytes for protection and prey capture. Even baby jellyfish, 
the size of a pencil eraser, have the ability to sting. Larval jellyfish, ephyrae, look like
tiny flowers pulsating in the sea. As they grow, they become umbrella-shaped
with a bell at the top and descending tentacles 
around the margin. The largest species of jellyfish,
the lion's mane, has tentacles that can extend 
more than 100 feet, longer than a blue whale. These tentacles contain 
most of the stinging cells, although some species have them
on their bells, too. Venom is ejected via a nematocyst, a whip-like hollow tubule, which lies coiled under 
high osmotic pressure. When mechanical or chemical stimuli
activate an external trigger, the lid of the cell pops open
and sea water rushes in. This forces a microscopic barbed
harpoon to shoot out, penetrate and inject 
venom into its victim. Nematocyst discharge can occur
in less than a millionth of a second, making it one of nature's fastest
biomechanical processes. Nematocysts can continue
to fire even after a jellyfish has died, so it's important to remove
lingering tentacles stuck to the skin. Rinsing with vinegar will usually render
undischarged nematocysts inactive. Seawater can also help 
remove residual nematocysts. But don't use fresh water
because any change in salt balance alters the osmotic pressure 
outside of the cnidocyte and will trigger the nematocyst to fire. That's why urinating on the affected area,
a common folk remedy, may do more harm that good,
depending on the composition of the urine. Most jellyfish stings 
are a painful nuisance, but some can be deadly. An Indo-Pacific box jelly,
also called a sea wasp, releases venom which can cause
contraction of the heart muscles and rapid death in large doses. There's an anti-venom,
but the venom is fast-acting, so you'd need immediate 
medical intervention. Despite the impressive power
in their tentacles, jellies aren't invincible. Their stinging cells are no match
for the armor of thick-skin predators, like the leatherback turtle
and ocean sunfish. These predators both have adaptations
that prevents slippery jellyfish from escaping after they are engulfed: backwards pointing spines 
in the turtle's mouth and esophagus and recurved teeth 
behind the sunfish's cheeks. Even tiny lobster slipper larvae
can cling to the bell of a jellyfish and hitch a ride, snacking on the jelly while they preserve
their own energy for growth. Small agile fish use the jellies
as moving reefs for protection, darting between tentacles
without ever touching them. Nudibranchs, which are sea slugs
covered in protective slime, can actually steal the jelly's defenses
by eating the cnidocytes and transferring them 
to specialized sacks for later use, as weapons against their own predators. Even humans might benefit
from the sting of a jellyfish one day. Scientists are working on manipulating
cnidocytes to deliver medicine, with nematocysts rarely 3% of the size
of a typical syringe needle. So, the next time you're out 
in the ocean, be careful. But also, take a second 
to marvel at its wonders."
42,3jIW5wW2WC0,How plants tell time - Dasha Savage,"In the 18th century, Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus
designed the flower clock, a timepiece made of flowering plants that bloom and close 
at specific times of day. Linnaeus's plan wasn't perfect,
but the idea behind it was correct. Flowers can indeed sense time,
after a fashion. Mornings glories unfurl their petals
like clockwork in the early morning. A closing white water lily 
signals that it's late afternoon, and moon flowers, as the name suggests,
only bloom under the night sky. But what gives plants 
this innate sense of time? It's not just plants, in fact. Many organisms on Earth
have a seemingly inherent awareness of where they are in the day's cycle. That's because of circadian rhythms, the internal timekeepers
that tick away inside many living things. These biological clocks allow organisms
to keep track of time and pick up on environmental cues
that help them adapt. That's important, because the planet's
rotations and revolutions put us in a state of constant flux, although it plays out in a repetitive,
predictable way. Circadian rhythms incorporate various cues to regulate when an organism 
should wake and sleep, and perform certain activities. For plants, light and temperature
are the cues which trigger reactions that play out at a molecular scale. The cells in stems, leaves, and flowers
contain phytochromes, tiny molecules that detect light. When that happens, phytochromes
initiate a chain of chemical reactions, passing the message down 
into the cellular nuclei. There, transcription factors trigger
the manufacture of proteins required to carry out 
light-dependent processes, like photosynthesis. These phytochromes not only sense
the amount of light the plant receives, but can also detect tiny differences in the distribution of wavelengths 
the plant takes in. With this fine-tuned sensing, phytochromes allow the plant
to discern both time, the difference between 
the middle of the day and the evening, and place, whether 
it is in direct sunlight or shade, enabling the plant to match
its chemical reactions to its environment. This makes for early risers. A few hours before sunrise,
a typical plant is already active, creating mRNA templates 
for its photosynthesizing machinery. As the phytochromes 
detect increasing sunlight, the plant readies 
its light-capturing molecules so it can photosynthesize
and grow throughout the morning. After harvesting their morning light, plants use the rest of the day
to build long chains of energy in the form of glucose polymers, 
like starch. The sun sets, and the day's work is done, though a plant is anything 
but inactive at night. In the absence of sunlight, they metabolize and grow, breaking down the starch from 
the previous day's energy harvest. Many plants have seasonal rhythms as well. As spring melts the winter frost, phytochromes sense the longer days
and increasing light, and a currently unknown mechanism
detects the temperature change. These systems pass the news
throughout the plant and make it produce blooming flowers in preparation for the pollinators
brought out by warmer weather. Circadian rhythms act as a link
between a plant and its environment. These oscillations come 
from the plants themselves. Each one has a default rhythm. Even so, these clocks 
can adapt their oscillations to environmental changes and cues. On a planet that's in constant flux, it's the circadian rhythms that enable
a plant to stay true to its schedule and to keep its own time."
43,GK_vRtHJZu4,Why is biodiversity so important? - Kim Preshoff,"Our planet's diverse thriving ecosystems
may seem like permanent fixtures, but they're actually 
vulnerable to collapse. Jungles can become deserts, and reefs can become lifeless rocks, even without cataclysmic events, 
like volcanoes and asteroids. What makes one ecosystem strong
and another weak in the face of change? The answer, to a large extent,
is biodiversity. Biodiversity is built out 
of three intertwined features: ecosystem diversity, species diversity, and genetic diversity. The more intertwining 
there is between these features, the denser and more resilient 
the weave becomes. Take the Amazon rainforest, one of the most biodiverse 
regions on Earth due to its complex ecosystems, huge mix of species, and the genetic variety 
within those species. Here are tangled liana vines, which crawl up from the forest floor 
to the canopy, intertwining with treetops and growing thick wooden stems
that support these towering trees. Helped along by the vines, trees provide the seeds, fruits
and leaves to herbivores, such as the tapir and the agouti, which disperse their seeds
throughout the forest so they can grow. Leftovers are consumed 
by the millions of insects that decompose and recycle nutrients
to create rich soil. The rainforest is a huge system filled
with many smaller systems, like this, each packed with interconnected species. Every link provides stability to the next, strengthening biodiversity's weave. That weave is further reinforced by the genetic diversity 
within individual species, which allows them to cope with changes. Species that lack genetic diversity
due to isolation or low population numbers, are much more vulnerable 
to fluctuations caused by climate change, disease
or habitat fragmentation. Whenever a species disappears
because of its weakened gene pool, a knot is untied 
and parts of the net disintegrate. So, what if we were to remove one species
from the rainforest? Would the system fall apart? Probably not. The volume of species, their genetic diversity, and the complexity of the ecosystems form such rich biodiversity in this forest that one species gap in the weave
won't cause it to unravel. The forest can stay resilient
and recover from change. But that's not true in every case. In some environments, taking away
just one important component can undermine the entire system. Take coral reefs, for instance. Many organisms in a reef
are dependent on the coral. It provides key microhabitats,
shelter and breeding grounds for thousand of species of fish,
crustaceans and mollusks. Corals also form interdependent 
relationships with fungi and bacteria. The coral itself is a loom that allows the tangled net 
of biodiversity to be woven. That makes coral a keystone organism, one that many others depend on
for their suvival. So what happens when destructive
fishing practices, pollution and ocean acidification weaken coral 
or even kill it altogether? Exactly what you might think. The loss of this keystone species
leaves its dependents at a loss, too, threatening the entire fabric of the reef. Ecosystem, species
and genetic diversity together form the complex tangled weave
of biodiversity that is vital for the survival 
of organisms on Earth. We humans are woven 
into this biodiversity, too. When just a few strands are lost, our own well-being is threatened. Cut too many links,
and we risk unraveling it all. What the future brings is unpredictable, but biodiversity can give 
us an insurance policy, Earth's own safety net 
to safeguard our survival."
44,yc2-363MIQs,The science of static electricity - Anuradha Bhagwat,"It can strike without warning,
at any moment. You may be walking across a soft carpet
and reaching for the door knob when suddenly...zap! To understand static electricity, we first need to know a bit
about the nature of matter. All matter is made up of atoms that consist of three 
types of smaller particles: negatively charged electrons, positively charged protons, and neutral neutrons. Normally, the electrons and protons
in an atom balance out, which is why most matter you come across
is electrically neutral. But electrons are tiny 
and almost insignificant in mass, and rubbing or friction can give
loosely bound electrons enough energy to leave their atoms
and attach to others, migrating between different surfaces. When this happens, the first object is left 
with more protons than electrons and becomes positively charged, while the one with more electrons
accumulates a negative charge. This situation is called
a charge imbalance, or net charge separation. But nature tends towards balance, so when one of these newly charged bodies
comes into contact with another material, the mobile electrons 
will take the first chance they get to go where they're most needed, either jumping off the negatively
charged object, or jumping onto 
the positively charged one in an attempt to restore 
the neutral charge equilibrium. And this quick movement of electrons,
called static discharge, is what we recognize as that sudden spark. This process doesn't happen 
with just any objects. Otherwise you'd be getting 
zapped all the time. Conductors like metals and salt water tend to have loosely 
bound outer electrons, which can easily flow between molecules. On the other hand, insulators 
like plastics, rubber and glass have tightly bound electrons
that won't readily jump to other atoms. Static build-up is most likely to occur when one of the materials involved
is an insulator. When you walk across a rug, electrons from your body
will rub off onto it, while the rug's insulating wool
will resist losing its own electrons. Although your body and the rug
together are still electrically neutral, there is now a charge polarization
between the two. And when you reach to touch the door knob, zap! The metal door knob's loosely 
bound electrons hop to your hand to replace the electrons 
your body has lost. When it happens in your bedroom,
it's a minor nuisance. But in the great outdoors, static electricity can be a terrifying,
destructive force of nature. In certain conditions,
charge separation will occur in clouds. We don't know exactly how this happens. It may have to do with the circulation
of water droplets and ice particles within them. Regardless, the charge 
imbalance is neutralized by being released towards another body, such as a building, the Earth, or another cloud in a giant spark
that we know as lightning. And just as your fingers can be zapped
over and over in the same spot, you better believe that lightning 
can strike the same place more than once."
45,YeSuQm7KfaE,How do geckos defy gravity? - Eleanor Nelsen,"It's midnight and all is still, except for the soft skittering 
of a gecko hunting a spider. Geckos seem to defy gravity, scaling vertical surfaces and walking upside down
without claws, adhesive glues or super-powered spiderwebs. Instead, they take advantage 
of a simple principle: that positive 
and negative charges attract. That attraction binds together 
compounds, like table salt, which is made of positively
charged sodium ions stuck to negatively charged chloride ions. But a gecko's feet aren't charged and neither are the surfaces 
they're walking on. So, what makes them stick? The answer lies in a clever combination
of intermolecular forces and stuctural engineering. All the elements in the periodic table
have a different affinity for electrons. Elements like oxygen and fluorine
really, really want electrons, while elements like hydrogen and lithium
don't attract them as strongly. An atom's relative greed for electrons
is called its electronegativity. Electrons are moving around all the time and can easily relocate
to wherever they're wanted most. So when there are atoms with different
electronegativities in the same molecule, the molecules cloud of electrons gets pulled towards 
the more electronegative atom. That creates a thin spot 
in the electron cloud where positive charge 
from the atomic nuclei shines through, as well as a negatively charged 
lump of electrons somewhere else. So the molecule itself isn't charged, but it does have positively 
and negatively charged patches. These patchy charges can attract
neighboring molecules to each other. They'll line up so that 
the positive spots on one are next to the negative 
spots on the other. There doesn't even have to be a strongly
electronegative atom to create these attractive forces. Electrons are always on the move, and sometimes they pile up 
temporarily in one spot. That flicker of charge is enough
to attract molecules to each other. Such interactions between 
uncharged molecules are called van der Waals forces. They're not as strong as the interactions
between charged particles, but if you have enough of them,
they can really add up. That's the gecko's secret. Gecko toes are padded 
with flexible ridges. Those ridges are covered 
in tiny hair-like structures, much thinner than human hair,
called setae. And each of the setae is covered 
in even tinier bristles called spatulae. Their tiny spatula-like shape is perfect
for what the gecko needs them to do: stick and release on command. When the gecko unfurls its flexible toes
onto the ceiling, the spatulae hit at the perfect angle
for the van der Waals force to engage. The spatulae flatten, creating lots of surface area 
for their positively and negatively charged patches to find
complimentary patches on the ceiling. Each spatula only contributes a minuscule
amount of that van der Waals stickiness. But a gecko has about two billion of them, creating enough combined force 
to support its weight. In fact, the whole gecko could dangle
from a single one of its toes. That super stickiness 
can be broken, though, by changing the angle just a little bit. So, the gecko can peel its foot back off, scurrying towards a meal
or away from a predator. This strategy, using a forest 
of specially shaped bristles to maximize the van der Waals forces 
between ordinary molecules has inspired man-made materials designed to imitate 
the gecko's amazing adhesive ability. Artificial versions aren't as strong
as gecko toes quite yet, but they're good enough to allow 
a full-grown man to climb 25 feet up a glass wall. In fact, our gecko's prey is also using
van der Waals forces to stick to the ceiling. So, the gecko peels up its toes
and the chase is back on."
46,RwtO04EXgUE,Where did Earth’s water come from? - Zachary Metz,"It has no taste, color or smell,
and we often look right through it. It covers over 70% of the Earth, cycling from the oceans and rivers
to the clouds and back again. It even makes up about 60% of our bodies. With all this water around and inside us, it's easy to take 
its presence for granted. But in the rest of the solar system,
liquid water is almost impossible to find. So how did our planet end up 
with so much of this substance and where did it come from? As you probably know, a water molecule consists 
of two basic parts. Hydrogen, the simplest of all elements, has been around since close 
to the beginning of our universe. Oxygen entered the scene 
several hundred million years later after stars began to form. The massive pressure at the center
of these fiery infernos was so great that hydrogen atoms 
fused together to form helium. Helium, in turn, fused 
to form heavier elements, like beryllium, carbon and oxygen
in a process known as nucleosynthesis. When stars eventually collapsed
and exploded into supernovas, these new elements 
were spread across the universe and combined into new compounds,
like the now familiar H2O. These water molecules 
were present in the dusty cloud that formed our solar system and more collided with our planet
after its formation. But there's a big question 
that we don't have the answer to: how much water arrived on Earth, and when? If, as one theory goes, relatively small amounts of water were
present on Earth when the rock formed, the high temperatures 
and lack of any surrounding atmosphere would have caused it 
to evaporate back into space. Water would have been unable 
to remain on the planet until hundreds of millions of years later when our first atmosphere formed
through a process called outgassing. This occurred when 
molten rock in the Earth's core released volcanic gasses to the surface, creating a layer 
that could then trap escaping water. So how then did water 
get back to the planet? Scientists have long suspected that much of it was brought
by ice-bearing comets, or more likely asteroids that bombarded
the Earth over millions of years. Recent research 
has challenged this theory. In examining carbonaceous 
chondrite meterorites that formed shorty after the birth
of our solar system, scientists have found 
that not only did they contain water, but their mineral chemical composition
matched rocks on Earth and samples from an asteroid that 
formed at the same time as our planet. This suggests that the Earth 
may have accumulated a substantial amount of water early on
that was able to stay put, despite the lack of an atmosphere, though asteroids may 
have brought more over the eons. If this turns out to be true, life may have formed much earlier
than previously thought. So we do not yet definitively know
whether the water on Earth came from its initial formation, later impacts, or some combination of the two. Regardless, the water that runs from our
showers, drinking fountains and faucets is something that didn't just come from
a nearby lake or river, but first underwent a cosmic 
and chaotic journey to get here."
47,g09BQes-B7E,How parasites change their host's behavior - Jaap de Roode,"Which of these entities 
has evolved the ability to manipulate an animal
many times its size? The answer is all of them. These are all parasites, organisms that live on 
or inside another host organism, which they harm and sometimes even kill. Parasite survival depends on transmitting
from one host to the next, sometimes through 
an intermediate species. Our parasites elegantly achieve this
by manipulating their host's behavior, sometimes through direct brain hijacking. For example, this is the Gordian worm. One of its hosts, this cricket. The Gordian worm needs water to mate,
but the cricket prefers dry land. So once it's big enough to reproduce, the worm produces proteins that garble
the cricket's navigational system. The confused cricket 
jumps around erratically, moves closer to water, and eventually leaps in,
often drowning in the process. The worm then wriggles out to mate and its eggs get eaten 
by little water insects that mature, colonize land, and are, in turn, eaten by new crickets. And thus, the Gordian worm lives on. And here's the rabies virus,
another mind-altering parasite. This virus infects mammals, often dogs, and travels up the animal's 
nerves to its brain where it causes inflammation 
that eventually kills the host. But before it does, it often increases
its host's aggressiveness and ramps up the production
of rabies-transmitting saliva, while making it hard to swallow. These factors make the host 
more likely to bite another animal and more likely to pass 
the virus on when it does. And now, meet Ophiocordyceps,
also known as the zombie fungus. Its host of choice is tropical ants
that normally live in treetops. After Ophiocordyceps spores 
pierce the ant's exoskeleton, they set off convulsions 
that make the ant fall from the tree. The fungus changes the ant's behavior,
compelling it to wander mindlessly until it stumbles onto a plant leaf with
the perfect fungal breeding conditions, which it latches onto. The ant then dies, and the fungus parasitizes its body
to build a tall, thin stalk from its neck. Within several weeks, 
the stalk shoots off spores, which turn more ants 
into six-legged leaf-seeking zombies. One of humanity's most deadly assailants
is a behavior-altering parasite, though if it's any consolation, it's not our brains 
that are being hijacked. I'm talking about Plasmodium,
which causes malaria. This parasite needs mosquitoes
to shuttle it between hosts, so it makes them bite more frequently
and for longer. There's also evidence 
that humans infected with malaria are more attractive to mosquitoes, which will bite them 
and transfer the parasite further. This multi-species system is so effective, that there are hundreds of millions
of malaria cases every year. And finally, there are cats. Don't worry, there probably 
aren't any cats living in your body and controlling your thoughts. I mean, probably. But there is a microorganism
called Toxoplasma that needs both cats and rodents
to complete its life cycle. When a rat gets infected
by eating cat feces, the parasite changes chemical levels
in the rat's brain, making it less cautious
around the hungry felines, maybe even attracted to them. This makes them easy prey, so these infected rodents
get eaten and pass the parasite on. Mind control successful. There's even evidence that the parasite
affects human behavior. In most cases, 
we don't completely understand how these parasites manage 
their feats of behavior modification. But from what we do know, we can tell that they have 
a pretty diverse toolbox. Gordian worms seem to affect
crickets' brains directly. The malaria parasite, on the other hand, blocks an enzyme 
that helps the mosquitoes feed, forcing them to bite over 
and over and over again. The rabies virus may cause 
that snarling, slobbering behavior by putting the immune system
into overdrive. But whatever the method, when you think about how effectively these parasites control 
the behavior of their hosts, you may wonder how much of human behavior
is actually parasites doing the talking. Since more than half of the species
on Earth are parasites, it could be more than we think."
48,9i7kAt97XYU,How we think complex cells evolved - Adam Jacobson,"What if you could absorb
another organism and take on its abilities? Imagine you swallowed a small bird
and suddenly gained the ability to fly. Or if you engulfed a cobra and were then able to spit poisonous venom
from your teeth. Throughout the history of life, specifically during the evolution 
of complex eukaryotic cells, things like this happened all the time. One organism absorbed another, and they united to become a new organism
with the combined abilities of both. We think that around 2 billion years ago, the only living organisms on Earth
were prokaryotes, single-celled organisms 
lacking membrane-bound organelles. Let's look closely at just three of them. One was a big, simple blob-like cell with the ability to absorb things 
by wrapping its cell membrane around them. Another was a bacterial cell that converted solar energy into sugar
molecules through photosynthesis. A third used oxygen gas to break down
materials like sugar and release its energy into a form useful
for life activities. The blob cells would occasionally absorb
the little photosynthetic bacteria. These bacteria then lived inside the blob
and divided like they always had, but their existence became linked. If you stumbled upon 
this living arrangement, you might just think that the whole thing
was one organism, that the green photosynthetic bacteria
were just a part of the blob that performed one of its life functions, just like your heart is a part of you that performs the function 
of pumping your blood. This process of cells living together
is called endosymbiosis, one organism living inside another. But the endosymbiosis didn't stop there. What would happen
if the other bacteria moved in, too? Now the cells of this species started
becoming highly complex. They were big and full 
of intricate structures that we call chloroplasts 
and mitochondria. These structures work together 
to harness sunlight, make sugar, and break down that sugar using the oxygen that right around this time started 
to appear in the Earth's atmosphere. Organisms absorbing other organisms was one way species adapted
to the changing environmental conditions of their surroundings. This little story highlights what 
biologists call the endosymbiotic theory, the current best explanation
of how complex cells evolved. There's a lot of evidence 
that supports this theory, but let's look at three main pieces. First, the chloroplasts and mitochondria
in our cells multiply the very same way as those ancient bacteria, which are still around, by the way. In fact, if you destroy these structures
in a cell, no new ones will appear. The cell can't make them. They can only make more of themselves. Second piece of evidence. Chloroplasts and mitochondria both contain
their own DNA and ribosomes. Their DNA has a circular structure that is strikingly similar to the DNA
of the ancient bacteria, and it also contains many similar genes. The ribosomes, or protein assembly 
machines of chloroplasts and mitochondria, also have the same structure as ribosomes
of ancient bacteria, but are different from the ribosomes hanging around
the rest of eukaryotic cell. Lastly, think about the membranes involved
in the engulfing process. Chloroplasts and mitochondria
both have two membranes surrounding them, an inner and outer membrane. Their inner membrane contains 
some particular lipids and proteins that are not present 
in the outer membrane. Why is that significant? Because their outer membrane
used to belong to the blob cell. When they were engulfed
in the endosymbiosis process, they got wrapped up in that membrane
and kept their own as their inner one. Surely enough, those same lipids and proteins are found on the membranes
of the ancient bacteria. Biologists now use this theory to explain the origin of the vast 
variety of eukaryotic organisms. Take the green algae that grow on 
the walls of swimming pools. A larger eukaryotic cell with spinning 
tail structures, or flagella, at some point absorbed algae like these
to form what we now call euglena. Euglena can perform photosynthesis, break down sugar using oxygen, and swim around pond water. And as the theory would predict, the chloroplasts in these euglena
have three membranes since they had two before being engulfed. The absorbing process
of endosymbiotic theory allowed organisms to combine 
powerful abilities to become better adapted to life on Earth. The results were species 
capable of much more than when they were separate organisms, and this was an evolutionary leap that lead to the microorganisms, plants, and animals we observe 
on the planet today."
49,p7fXa2Occ_U,"How do dogs \""see\"" with their noses? - Alexandra Horowitz","""Hi, Bob."" ""Morning, Kelly. The tulips looks great."" Have you ever wondered
how your dog experiences the world? Here's what she sees. Not terribly interesting. But what she smells,
that's a totally different story. And it begins at her wonderfully 
developed nose. As your dog catches 
the first hints of fresh air, her nose's moist, spongy outside helps
capture any scents the breeze carries. The ability to smell 
separately with each nostril, smelling in stereo, helps to determine the direction 
of the smell's source so that within the first 
few moments of sniffing, the dog starts to become aware of not
just what kind of things are out there but also where they're located. As air enters the nose, a small fold of tissue 
divides it into two separate folds, one for breathing 
and one just for smelling. This second airflow enters a region filled with highly specialized 
olfactory receptor cells, several hundred millions of them,
compaired to our five million. And unlike our clumsy way of breathing 
in and out through the same passage, dogs exhale through slits 
at the side of their nose, creating swirls of air that help
draw in new odor molecules and allow odor concentration to build up
over mulitple sniffs. But all that impressive nasal architecture
wouldn't be much help without something to process the loads
of information the nose scoops up. And it turns out that the olfactory system
dedicated to proessing smells takes up many times more relative
brain area in dogs than in humans. All of this allows dogs to distinguish and remember a staggering 
variety of specific scents at concentrations up to 100 million times
less than what our noses can detect. If you can smell a spritz of perfume
in a small room, a dog would have no trouble smelling it
in an enclosed stadium and distinguishing its ingredients,
to boot. And everything in the street,
every passing person or car, any contents of the neighbor's trash, each type of tree, and all the birds and insects in it has a distinct odor profile telling
your dog what it is, where it is, and which direction it's moving in. Besides being much 
more powerful than ours, a dog's sense of smell can pick up things
that can't even be seen at all. A whole separate olfactory system, called the vomeronasal organ,
above the roof of the mouth, detects the hormones all animals,
Including humans, naturally release. It lets dogs identify potential mates, or distinguish between friendly 
and hostile animals. It alerts them to our various 
emotional states, and it can even tell them 
when someone is pregnant or sick. Because olfaction is more primal 
than other senses, bypassing the thalamus to connect
directly to the brain structures involving emotion and instinct, we might even say a dog's perception 
is more immediate and visceral than ours. But the most amazing thing about 
your dog's nose is that it can traverse time. The past appears in tracks 
left by passersby, and by the warmth 
of a recently parked car where the residue of where you've been
and what you've done recently. Landmarks like fire hydrants and trees are aromatic bulletin boards 
carrying messages of who's been by, what they've been eating, and how they're feeling. And the future is in the breeze, alerting them to something or someone
approaching long before you see them. Where we see and hear something
at a single moment, a dog smells an entire story
from start to finish. In some of the best examples
of canine-human collaboration, dogs help us by sharing
and reacting to those stories. They can respond with kindness
to people in distress, or with aggression to threats because stress and anger 
manifest as a cloud of hormones recognizable to the dog's nose. With the proper training, they can even alert us 
to invisible threats ranging from bombs to cancer. As it turns out, humanity's best friend is not one who experiences 
the same things we do, but one whose incredible nose reveals 
a whole other world beyond our eyes."
50,Z8wLQ3NCBgg,The truth about bats - Amy Wray,"Flying through the night, 
I watch over this world, a silent guardian, a watchful protector,
a dark knight, I'm... Okay, fine. So, I'm not Batman.
I'm just a bat. But like Batman, I'm often misunderstood. People think I'm scary, 
strange and dangerous. If they only knew my story, though,
I'd be cheered as a hero. When people think of bats, many think of vampires 
who want to suck their blood. But the truth is 
that out of over 1200 bat species, only three are vampire bats. Out of these three, 
only one prefers the blood of mammals, and even these bats mostly feed on cattle. Maybe that still doesn't seem so great, but vampire bats 
can be a great help to humans. A chemical known as desmoteplase 
found in vampire bat saliva helps break down blood clots, and is being tested 
by recovering stroke victims. Of the remaining 1000+ species of bats, 
about 70% feed on insects. These bats help control 
the real vampires: mosquitos, whose nasty bites
are not just annoying but spread diseases, like West Nile virus. A single little brown bat 
can eat 1000 insects every hour, and a colony of Mexican free-tailed bats 
can eat several tons of moths in just one night. In the United States alone, bats provide an estimated 
3.7 billion dollars worth of free pest control for farmers, which benefits everyone 
who eats the foods that they grow. Fruit bats, also called megabats 
because of their large size, are important for the role 
they play in plant pollination. By traveling between flowers 
while feeding on nectar and fruits, these bats transport the pollen 
and seeds that help plants reproduce. In Southeast Asia, for example, the cave nectar bat is the only pollinator
of the durian fruit. Other bats pollinate peaches, bananas, and the agave plants 
that tequila is made from. Without them, many of our food plants would be unable 
to produce the tasty fruits we enjoy. As heroes of the ecosystem, 
bats have their own unique utility belts. Bats have been a source of inspiration 
for the design of flying robots and even an energy-efficient spy plane, as they are the only mammal 
capable of true powered flight. Echolocation, a type of biological sonar,
is also used by bats as a way to navigate and find prey in the dark. Although there's a common 
misconception that bats are blind, in truth, all species of bats have sight. And some have even adapted 
large eyes to see better in dim lighting. Many people worry 
about getting infected by bats, and like any other animals,
bats can carry diseases, like rabies. In reality, though, less than .5% of all bats
carry this virus. That's about the same odds as getting 
the same result on a coin flip eight times in a row. The perception that bats 
are often diseased may come from the fact that sick bats, who may show unusual behavior, 
emerge during the daytime, or be unable to fly, are more likely to be 
encountered by people. So a good way to protect yourself 
is to protect bats as well, keeping them healthy,
protecting their habitats, and reducing their risk 
of transmitting disease. In North America, bats are threatened 
by a devastating sickness called white-nose syndrome. This fungal infection 
causes bats to wake up while hibernating during a winter. Unable to find food, 
they expend large amounts of energy, and eventually starve to death. White-nose syndrome has wiped out
entire caves full of bats, with a mortality rate that can exceed 90%. Climate change and habitat destruction also pose serious threats 
to bat populations. For example, in January 2014,
a record heat wave in Australia caused over 100,000 bats 
to die from heat exhaustion. Some people just want 
to watch the world burn, and bats all over the world are threatened
by damage to the places that we call home, including mangrove swamps, old-growth forests, and, of course, bat caves. So even though I'm the hero of the story,
I do need to be saved. And now that you know 
the true story about us bats, you can learn how to protect 
such heroic animals. Install a properly designed bat box, one of the easiest ways 
to provide shelter for bats. Discourage the use of pesticides,
which can harm bats when we try to feed on the insects 
you want to get rid of in the first place. Avoid going into caves 
where you might disturb hibernating bats, and always decontaminate 
your gear after visiting a cave. If you have unwanted bats 
living in an attic or barn, contact your local government 
to safely and humanely relocate us. And if you come across a bat, 
do not attempt to handle it, but instead, call Animal Control. Batman might want to keep 
his identity secret, but a great way to help real bats
is by continuing to learn about them and spreading the truth 
that they are real heroes, even if their good deeds are often unseen."
51,B-vYGcl_nA8,The hidden worlds within natural history museums - Joshua Drew,"When you think of natural history museums, you probably picture exhibits 
filled with ancient lifeless things, like dinosaurs meteroites, and gemstones. But behind that educational exterior, which only includes 
about 1% of a museum's collection, there are hidden laboratories 
where scientific breakthroughs are made. Beyond the unmarked doors, and on the floors 
the elevators won't take you to, you'd find windows into amazing worlds. This maze of halls and laboratories 
is a scientific sanctuary that houses a seemingly 
endless variety of specimens. Here, researchers work to unravel 
mysteries of evolution, cosmic origins, and the history of our planet. One museum alone 
may have millions of specimens. The American Museum of Natural History
in New York City has over 32,000,000 in its collection. Let's take a look at just one of them. Scientists have logged exactly
where and when it was found and used various dating techniques 
to pinpoint when it originated. Repeat that a million times over,
and these plants, animals, minerals, fossils, and artifacts present windows 
into times and places around the world and across billions of years of history. When a research problem emerges, scientists peer through these windows
and test hypotheses about the past. For example, in the 1950s, 
populations of predatory birds, like peregrine falcons, owls, and eagles started to mysteriously crash, to the point where a number of species,
including the bald eagle, were declared endangered. Fortunately, scientists in 
The Field Museum in Chicago had been collecting the eggs 
of these predatory birds for decades. They discovered that the egg shells 
used to be thicker and had started to thin around the time when an insecticide called DDT 
started being sprayed on crops. DDT worked very well to kill insects, but when birds came and ate
those heaps of dead bugs, the DDT accumulated in their bodies. It worked its way up the food chain and was absorbed by apex predator birds
in such high concentrations that it thinned their eggs so that they couldn't support 
the nesting bird's weight. There were omelettes everywhere until scientists from 
The Field Museum in Chicago, and other institutions, helped solve the mystery and save the day. America thanks you, Field Museum. Natural history museums 
windows into the past have solved many other 
scientific mysteries. Museum scientists have used 
their collections to sequence the Neanderthal genome, discover genes that gave mammoths red fur, and even pinpoint where 
ancient giant sharks gave birth. There are about 900 
natural history museums in the world, and every year they make 
new discoveries and insights into the Earth's past, present and future. Museum collections even help us 
understand how modern threats, such as global climate change, are impacting our world. For instance, 
naturalists have been collecting samples for over 100 years from Walden Pond, famously immortalized 
by Henry David Thoreau. Thanks to those naturalists,
who count Thoreau among their number, we know that the plants around Walden Pond are blooming over three weeks earlier 
than they did 150 years ago. Because these changes 
have taken place gradually, one person may not have noticed them
over the span of a few decades, but thanks to museum collections, we have an uninterrupted record 
showing how our world is changing. So the next time you're exploring 
a natural history museum, remember that what you're seeing 
is just one gem of a colossal scientific treasure trove. Behind those walls and under your feet
are windows into forgotten worlds. And who knows? One day some future scientist may 
peer through one and see you."
52,lSXNqsOoURg,Why elephants never forget - Alex Gendler,"It's a common saying
that elephants never forget, but these magnificent animals are more
than giant walking hard drives. The more we learn about elephants, the more it appears
that their impressive memory is only one aspect
of an incredible intelligence that makes them
some of the most social, creative, and benevolent creatures on Earth. Unlike many proverbs,
the one about elephant memory is scientifically accurate. Elephants know every member
in their herd, able to recognize as many as 30
companions by sight or smell. This is a great help when migrating or encountering
other potentially hostile elephants. They also remember and distinguish
particular cues that signal danger and can recall important locations long
after their last visit. But it's the memories unrelated
to survival that are the most fascinating. Elephants remember
not only their herd companions but other creatures who have made
a strong impression on them. In one case, two circus elephants
that had briefly performed together rejoiced when crossing paths
23 years later. This recognition isn't limited to others
of their species. Elephants have also recognized humans
they've bonded with after decades apart. All of this shows that elephant memory
goes beyond responses to stimuli. Looking inside their heads,
we can see why. The elephant boasts the largest brain
of any land mammal, as well as an impressive
encephalization quotient. This is the size of the brain
relative to what we'd expect for an animal's body size, and the elephant's EQ is nearly as high
as a chimpanzee's. And despite the distant relation, convergent evolution has made it
remarkably similar to the human brain, with as many neurons and synapses and a highly developed hippocampus
and cerebral cortex. It is the hippocampus, strongly associated
with emotion, that aids recollection by encoding important experiences
into long-term memories. The ability to distinguish this importance
makes elephant memory a complex and adaptable faculty
beyond rote memorization. It's what allows elephants who survived
a drought in their youth to recognize its warning signs
in adulthood, which is why clans with older matriarchs
have higher survival rates. Unfortunately, it's also what makes
elephants one of the few non-human animals to suffer from post-traumatic
stress disorder. The cerebral cortex, on the other hand,
enables problem solving, which elephants display
in many creative ways. They also tackle problems cooperatively, sometimes even outwitting the researchers
and manipulating their partners. And they've grasped basic arithmetic,
keeping track of the relative amounts of fruit in two baskets
after multiple changes. The rare combination of memory
and problem solving can explain some of elephants'
most clever behaviors, but it doesn't explain some of the things
we're just beginning to learn about their mental lives. Elephants communicate using everything
from body signals and vocalizations, to infrasound rumbles that can be heard
kilometers away. And their understanding of syntax suggests that
they have their own language and grammar. This sense of language may even go beyond
simple communication. Elephants create art by carefully
choosing and combining different colors and elements. They can also recognize twelve distinct
tones of music and recreate melodies. And yes, there is an elephant band. But perhaps the most amazing thing
about elephants is a capacity even more important
than cleverness: their sense of empathy,
altruism, and justice. Elephants are the only non-human animals
to mourn their dead, performing burial rituals
and returning to visit graves. They have shown concern
for other species, as well. One working elephant refused
to set a log down into a hole where a dog was sleeping, while elephants encountering injured
humans have sometimes stood guard and gently comforted them
with their trunk. On the other hand, elephant attacks
on human villages have usually occurred right after
massive poachings or cullings, suggesting deliberate revenge. When we consider all this evidence, along with the fact that elephants
are one of the few species who can recognize themselves in a mirror, it's hard to escape the conclusion that they are conscious,
intelligent, and emotional beings. Unfortunately, humanity's treatment
of elephants does not reflect this, as they continue to suffer
from habitat destruction in Asia, ivory poaching in Africa,
and mistreatment in captivity worldwide. Given what we now know about elephants and what they continue to teach us
about animal intelligence, it is more important than ever to ensure that what the English poet John Donne
described as ""nature's great masterpiece"" does not vanish from the world's canvas."
53,z9HIYjRRaDE,Where do genes come from? - Carl Zimmer,"You have about 20,000 genes in your DNA. They encode the molecules that
make up your body, from the keratin in your toenails,
to the collagen at the tip of your nose, to the dopamine surging around
inside your brain. Other species have genes of their own. A spider has genes for spider silk. An oak tree has genes for chlorophyll,
which turns sunlight into wood. So where did all those genes come from? It depends on the gene. Scientists suspect that life
started on Earth about 4 billion years ago. The early life forms were
primitive microbes with a basic set of genes for
the basic tasks required to stay alive. They passed down those basic genes
to their offspring through billions of generations. Some of them still do the same jobs
in our cells today, like copying DNA. But none of those microbes had genes
for spider silk or dopamine. There are a lot more genes on Earth today
than there were back then. It turns out that a lot of those
extra genes were born from mistakes. Each time a cell divides,
it makes new copies of its DNA. Sometimes it accidentally copies
the same stretch of DNA twice. In the process, it may make an extra copy
of one of its genes. At first, the extra gene works the same
as the original one. But over the generations, 
it may pick up new mutations. Those mutations may change how
the new gene works, and that new gene may duplicate again. A surprising number of our 
mutated genes emerged more recently; many in just the past few million years. The youngest evolved after our own species
broke off from our cousins, the apes. While it may take over a million years
for a single gene to give rise to a whole family of genes, scientists are finding that once 
the new genes evolve, they can quickly take on
essential functions. For example, we have hundreds of genes
for the proteins in our noses that grab odor molecules. The mutations let them grab
different molecules, giving us the power to perceive trillions
of different smells. Sometimes mutations have
a bigger effect on new copies of genes. They may cause a gene to make its
protein in a different organ, or at a different time of life, or the protein may start doing
a different job altogether. In snakes, for example, there's a gene
that makes a protein for killing bacteria. Long ago, the gene duplicated
and the new copy mutated. That mutation changed
the signal in the gene about where it should make its protein. Instead of becoming active in
the snake's pacreas, it started making this bacteria-killing
protein in the snake's mouth. So when the snake bit its prey,
this enzyme got into the animal's wound. And when this protein proved
to have a harmful effect, and helped the snake catch more prey, it became favored. So now what was a gene in the pancreas
makes a venom in the mouth that kills the snake's prey. And there are even more incredible ways
to make a new gene. The DNA of animals and plants
and other species contain huge stretches without any
protein coding genes. As far as scientists can tell,
its mostly random sequences of genetic gibberish that serve
no function. These stretches of DNA
sometimes mutate, just like genes do. Sometimes those mutations
turn the DNA into a place where a cell can start reading it. Suddenly the cell is making a new protein. At first, the protein may be useless,
or even harmful, but more mutations can 
change the shape of the protein. The protein may start
doing something useful, something that makes an organism
healthier, stronger, better able to reproduce. Scientists have found these new genes
at work in many parts of animal bodies. So our 20,000 genes have many origins, from the origin of life, to new genes
still coming into existence from scratch. As long as life is here on Earth,
it will be making new genes."
54,inVZoI1AkC8,Feedback loops: How nature gets its rhythms - Anje-Margriet Neutel,"Testing, testing, one, two, three. When your band is trying to perform,
feedback is an annoying obstacle, but in the grand orchestra of nature,
feedback is not only beneficial, it's what makes everything work. What exactly is feedback? The key element, whether in sound,
the environment or social science, is a phenomenon called
mutual causal interaction, where x affects y, y affects x, and so on, creating an ongoing process called 
a feedback loop. And the natural world is full 
of these mechanisms formed by the links between living 
and nonliving things that build resilience by governing 
the way populations and food webs respond to events. When plants die, the dead material
enriches the soil with humus, a stable mass of organic matter,
providing moisture and nutrients for other plants to grow. The more plants grow and die,
the more humus is produced, allowing even more plants to grow,
and so on. This is an example of positive feedback, an essential force
in the buildup of ecosystems. But it's not called positive feedback
because it's beneficial. Rather, it is positive because it amplifies
a particular effect or change from previous conditions. These positive, or amplifying, loops
can also be harmful, like when removing a forest 
makes it vulnerable to erosion, which removes organic matter
and nutrients from the earth, leaving less plants to anchor the soil,
and leading to more erosion. In contrast, negative feedback diminishes
or counteracts changes in an ecosystem to maintain a more stable balance. Consider predators and their prey. When lynx eat snowshoe hares,
they reduce their population, but this drop in the lynx's food source will
soon cause their own population to decline, reducing the predation rate and allowing 
the hare population to increase again. The ongoing cycle creates an up and down
wavelike pattern, maintaining a long-term equilibrium and
allowing a food chain to persist over time. Feedback processes might seem
counterintuitive because many of us are used to more predictable linear
scenarios of cause and effect. For instance, it seems simple enough that spraying pesticides would help plants grow
by killing pest insects, but it may trigger a host of other
unexpected reactions. For example, if spraying pushes down
the insect population, its predators will have less food. As their population dips, the reduced predation would allow the
insect population to rise, counteracting the effects of 
our pesticides. Note that each feedback is
the product of the links in the loop. Add one negative link and it will
reverse the feedback force entirely, and one weak link will reduce the
effect of the entire feedback considerably. Lose a link, and the whole loop is broken. But this is only a simple example, since natural communities consist not 
of separate food chains, but networks of interactions. Feedback loops will often be indirect,
occurring through longer chains. A food web containing twenty populations
can generate thousands of loops of up to twenty links in length. But instead of forming a disordered 
cacophany, feedback loops in ecological systems
play together, creating regular patterns
just like multiple instruments, coming together to create a complex
but harmonious piece of music. Wide-ranging negative feedbacks
keep the positive feedbacks in check, like drums maintaining a rhythm. You can look at the way a particular
ecosystem functions within its unique habitat as representing its trademark sound. Ocean environments dominated 
by predator-prey interactions, and strong negative and positive loops
stabilized by self-damping feedback, are powerful and loud,
with many oscillations. Desert ecosystems, where the 
turn over of biomass is slow, and the weak feedbacks loops through dead
matter are more like a constant drone. And the tropical rainforest,
with its great diversity of species, high nutrient turnover, and strong feedbacks
among both living and dead matter, is like a lush panoply of sounds. Despite their stabilizing effects, many of these habitats and their 
ecosystems develop and change over time, as do the harmonies they create. Deforestation may turn lush tropics
into a barren patch, like a successful ensemble breaking up
after losing its star performers. But an abandoned patch of farmland
may also become a forest over time, like a garage band growing into
a magnificent orchestra."
55,lmWh9jV_1ac,How do tornadoes form? - James Spann,"They call me the tornado chaser. When the wind is up 
and conditions are right, I get in my car and follow violent storms. ""Crazy,"" you say? Perhaps, but really I
chase these sky beasts to learn about them. I want to share with you what I know. Tornadoes are rapidly rotating columns
of air that form inside storms that connect with the ground via
a funnel of cloud. When that happens, 
they tear across the Earth, posing a huge threat to life and property. Because of this, there's a great deal
of research into these phenomena, but the truth is, there's still a lot
we don't know about how tornadoes form. The conditions that may 
give rise to one tornado won't necessarily cause another. But we have learned a lot since
people first started recording tornadoes, like how to recognize the signs
when one is brewing in the sky. Are you coming along for the ride? Tornadoes begin with a thunderstorm
but not just any thunderstorm. These are especially powerful, towering
thunderstorms called supercells. Reaching up to over 50,000 feet,
they bring high force winds, giant hailstones, sometimes flooding
and great flashes of lightning, too. These are the kinds of storms
that breed tornadoes, but only if there are also very
specific conditions in place, clues that we can measure and look out for
when we're trying to forecast a storm. Rising air is the first ingredient needed
for a tornado to develop. Any storm is formed 
when condensation occurs, the byproducts of the clouds. Condensation releases heat, and heat becomes the energy that drives
huge upward drafts of air. The more condensation
and the bigger the storm clouds grow, the more powerful those updrafts become. In supercells, this rising airmass 
is particularly strong. As the air climbs, it can change direction
and start to move more quickly. Finally, at the storm's base,
if there is a lot of moisture, a huge cloud base develops,
giving the tornado something to feed off later,
if it gets that far. When all these things are in place,
a vortex can develop enclosed by the storm, and forming a wide, tall tube of spinning
air that then gets pulled upwards. We call this a mesocyclone. Outside, cool, dry, sinking air starts to wrap around the back of
this mesocyclone, forming what's known as a
rear flank downdraft. This unusual scenario creates 
a stark temperature difference between the air inside the mesocyclone,
and the air outside, building up a level of instability
that allows a tornado to thrive. Then, the mesocyclone's lower part
becomes tighter, increasing the speed of the wind. If, and that's a big if,
this funnel of air moves down into that large, moist cloud base
at the bottom of the parent storm, it sucks it in and turns it 
into a rotating wall of cloud, forming a link between 
the storm that created it and the Earth. The second that tube of
spinning cloud touches the ground, it becomes a tornado. Most are small and short-lived,
producing winds of 65-110 miles per hour, but others can last for over an hour,
producing 200 mile per hour winds. They are beautiful but terrifying, especially if you or 
your town is in its path. In that case, no one,
not even tornado chasers like me, enjoy watching thing unfold. Just like everything, however,
tornadoes do come to an end. When the temperature difference disappears
and conditions grow more stable, or the moisture in the air dries up, the once fierce parent storm loses
momentum and draws its tornado back inside. Even so, meteorologists and storm chasers
like me will remain on the lookout, watching, always watching to see
if the storm releases its long rope again."
56,KMudRLPZidg,What's hidden among the tallest trees on Earth? - Wendell Oshiro,"Some people can't see 
the forest for the trees, but before Stephen Sillett, no one could see
or even imagine the forest in the trees. Stephen was an explorer of 
new worlds from the start. He spent his boyhood in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania reading Tolkien and playing 
Dungeons and Dragons with his brother Scott. But when the Sillett family visited 
their grandparent's cabin near Gettysburg, their grandmother Helen Poe Sillett, would take the boys into the nearby 
mountains and forests to bird-watch. They called Grandma Sillett Poe, and she taught the boys to identify 
songbirds, plants and even lichens, creatures that often look like splotches of carpet
glued to the shady sides of rocks and tree trunks. Looking upwards, 
both boys found their callings. Scott became a research scientist 
specializing in migratory birds. Stephen was more interested in the trees. The tangle of branches and leaves
attracted his curiosity. What could be hidden up there? By the time Stephen was in college,
that curiosity pulled him skyward to the tallest trees on Earth:
the ancient coast redwoods of Northern California. Rising from trunks 
up to 20 feet in diameter, redwoods can grow up to 380 feet, or 38 stories,
over a 2,000 year lifetime. But no one had thought to investigate 
the crowns of these natural skyscrapers. Were there more than 
just branches up there? Stephen decided to find out firsthand. In 1987, Stephen, his brother Scott
and his friend Marwood drove from Reed College in Oregon to Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park
in Northern California. Deep inside the park,
Stephen picked the tallest redwood he could find. Its lowest branches
were almost 100 feet up, far beyond his reach. But he saw a younger, shorter redwood 
growing next to the target tree. With a running start, he leapt 
and grabbed the lowest branch, pulled himself up and scurried upwards. He was free climbing
without ropes or a harness, one misstep meant death. But up he went, 
and when he reached the peak, he swayed and leapt across the gap of space
onto a branch of the target tree and into a world never seen before. His buddy Marwood followed him up, and the two young men free climbed
high into the redwood's crown. Stephen came across lichens
like Grandma Poe had shown him as a boy. He noticed that the higher he went,
the thicker the branches were, not the case with most trees. He found moist mats of soil many inches thick, made from fallen needles, bark,
other plant debris and dust from the sky piled on the tops of the large branches. He even found reiterations: new redwood tree trunks 
growing out from the main trunk. The redwood had cloned itself. When Stephen reached the pinnacle, he rested on a platform of 
crisscrossing branches and needles. Growing in the soil mat was a 
huckleberry bush with ripe berries! He ate some and waited for his friend. Stephen had discovered a new world
hundreds of feet above the ground. His climb led to more excursions,
with safety equipment, thank goodness, up other ancient redwoods
as he mapped and measured the architecture of branches and additional trunks
in the canopy of an entire grove. Stephen became an expert
in the ecology of the tallest trees on Earth and the rich diversity of life in their crowns,
aerial ecosystems no one had imagined. There are ferns, fungi and epiphytic trees
normally found at ground level like Douglas firs, hemlocks and tan oaks whose roots had taken hold
in the rich wet soil mats. Invertebrates such as ants, bumblebees, 
mites, beetles, earthworms and aquatic crustacean copepods make their homes alongside
flowering plants like rhododendrons, currant
and elderberry bushes. Ospreys, spotted owls, and jays
search the canopy for food. Even the marbled murrelet, 
a Pacific seabird, flies many miles from the ocean
to nest there. Squirrels and voles 
peek out of penthouse burrows. And the top predator?
The mighty wandering salamander! Sillett's research has changed
how we think about tall trees, and bolstered the case
for their conservation, not just as impressive
individual organisms but as homes to countless other species. So when you look up into 
the branches and leaves of a tree, ask, ""What else is up there?"" A new world might be just out of reach.
So leap for it."
57,ujKL1pUHDfo,The coelacanth: A living fossil of a fish - Erin Eastwood,"The dead coming back to life sounds scary. But for scientists, it can be
a wonderful opportunity. Of course, we're not talking about zombies. Rather, this particular opportunity
came in the unlikely form of large, slow-moving fish
called the coelacanth. This oddity dates back 360 million years, and was believed to have died out
during the same mass extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs
65 million years ago. To biologists and paleontologists,
this creature was a very old and fascinating but entirely extinct fish,
forever fossilized. That is, until 1938 when Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer,
a curator at a South African museum, came across a prehistoric looking, gleaming
blue fish hauled up at the nearby docks. She had a hunch that this strange,
1.5 meter long specimen was important but couldn't preserve it in time
to be studied and had it taxidermied. When she finally was able to
reach J.L.B. Smith, a local fish expert, he was able to confirm, at first site,
that the creature was indeed a coelacanth. But it was another 14 years before
a live specimen was found in the Comoros Islands, allowing scientists to
closely study a creature that had barely evolved
in 300 million years. A living fossil. Decades later, a second species
was found near Indonesia. The survival of creatures
thought extinct for so long proved to be one of the
biggest discoveries of the century. But the fact that the coelacanth
came back from the dead isn't all that makes
this fish so astounding. Even more intriguing is the fact that
genetically and morphologically, the coelacanth has more in common
with four-limbed vertebrates than almost any other fish,
and its smaller genome is ideal for study. This makes the coelacanth a powerful link
between aquatic and land vertebrates, a living record of their transition from
water to land millions of years ago. The secret to this transition is in the fins. While the majority of ocean fish
fall into the category of ray-finned fishes, coelacanths are part of a much smaller,
evolutionarily distinct group with thicker fins known as lobe-finned fish. Six of the coelacanth's fins contain bones
organized much like our limbs, with one bone connecting
the fin to the body, another two connecting the bone
to the tip of the fin, and several small,
finger-like bones at the tip. Not only are those fins structured
in pairs to move in a synchronized way, the coelacanth even shares
the same genetic sequence that promotes limb development
in land vertebrates. So although the coelacanth
itself isn't a land-walker, its fins do resemble those
of its close relatives who first hauled their bodies onto land with the help of these
sturdy, flexible appendages, acting as an evolutionary bridge
to the land lovers that followed. So that's how this prehistoric fish
helps explain the evolutionary movement of vertebrates from water to land. Over millions of years, 
that transition led to the spread of all
four-limbed animals, called tetrapods, like amphibians, birds, and even
the mammals that are our ancestors. There's even another powerful clue in that unlike most fish,
coelacanths don't lay eggs, instead giving birth to live, young pups,
just like mammals. And this prehistoric fish will continue to
provide us with fascinating information about the migration of vertebrates
out of the ocean over 300 million years ago. A journey that ultimately drove
our own evolution, survival and existence. Today the coelacanth remains the symbol
of the wondrous mysteries that remain to be uncovered by science. With so much left to learn about this fish,
the ocean depths and evolution itself, who knows what other well-kept secrets
our future discoveries may bring to life!"
58,vG-QZOTc5_Q,Inside the ant colony - Deborah M. Gordon,"Think about all the things that need to happen for a human settlement to thrive: obtaining food, building shelter, raising children and more. There needs to be a way to divide resources, organize major efforts and distribute labor efficiently. Now imagine having to do this without any sort of planning or higher level communication. Welcome to the ant colony. Ants have some of the most complex social organization in the animal kingdom, living in structured colonies containing different types of members who perform specific roles. But although this may sound similar to some human societies, this organization doesn't arise from any higher level decisions, but is part of a biologically programmed cycle. In many species, all the winged males and winged virgin queens from all the nearby colonies in the population each leave from their different nests and meet at a central place to mate, using pheromones to guide each other to a breeding ground. After mating, the males die off, while females try to establish a new colony. The few that are successful settle down in a suitable spot, lose their wings, and begin laying eggs, selectively fertilizing some using stored sperm they've saved up from mating. Fertilized eggs grow into female workers who care for the queen and her eggs. They will then defend the colony and forage for food, while unfertilized eggs grow into males whose only job is to wait until they are ready to leave the nest and reproduce, beginning the cycle again. So how do worker ants decide what to do and when? Well, they don't really. Although they have no methods of intentional communication, individual ants do interact with one another through touch, sound and chemical signals. These stimuli accomplish many things from serving as an alarm to other ants if one is killed, to signaling when a queen is nearing the end of her reproductive life. But one of the most impressive collective capabilities of an ant colony is to thoroughly and efficiently explore large areas without any predetermined plan. Most species of ants have little or no sense of sight and can only smell things in their vicinity. Combined with their lack of high level coordination, this would seem to make them terrible explorers, but there is an amazingly simple way that ants maximize their searching efficiency; by changing their movement patterns based on individual interactions. When two ants meet, they sense each other by touching antennae. If there are many ants in a small area this will happen more often causing them to respond by moving in more convoluted, random paths in order to search more thoroughly. But in a larger area, with less ants, where such meetings happen less often, they can walk in straight lines to cover more ground. While exploring their environment in this way, an ant may come across any number of things, from threats or enemies, to alternate nesting sites. And some species have another capability known as recruitment. When one of these ants happens to find food, it will return with it, marking its path with a chemical scent. Other ants will then follow this pheromone trail, renewing it each time they manage to find food and return. Once the food in that spot is depleted, the ants stop marking their return. The scent dissipates and ants are no longer attracted to that path. These seemingly crude methods of search and retrieval are, in fact, so useful that they are applied in computer models to obtain optimal solutions from decentralized elements, working randomly and exchanging simple information. This has many theoretical and practical applications, from solving the famous traveling salesman problem, to scheduling computing tasks and optimizing Internet searches, to enabling groups of robots to search a minefield or a burning building collectively, without any central control. But you can observe these fascinatingly simple, yet effective, processes directly through some simple experiments, by allowing ants to enter empty spaces of various sizes and paying attention to their behavior. Ants may not be able to vote, hold meetings or even make any plans, but we humans may still be able to learn something from the way that such simple creatures are able to function so effectively in such complex ways."
59,fHztd6k5ZXY,A guide to the energy of the Earth - Joshua M. Sneideman,"Energy is all around us, a physical quantity that follows
precise natural laws. Our universe has a finite amount of it; it's neither created nor destroyed but can take different forms, such as kinetic or potential energy, with different properties
and formulas to remember. For instance, an LED desk lamp's 6 Watt bulb transfers 6 Joules
of light energy per second. But let's jump back up into space to look at our planet,
its systems, and their energy flow. Earth's physical systems include the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere. Energy moves in and out of these systems, and during any energy
transfer between them, some is lost to the surroundings, as heat, light, sound, vibration, or movement. Our planet's energy comes from
internal and external sources. Geothermal energy
from radioactive isotopes and rotational energy
from the spinning of the Earth are internal sources of energy, while the Sun
is the major external source, driving certain systems,
like our weather and climate. Sunlight warms the surface and atmosphere
in varying amounts, and this causes convection, producing winds
and influencing ocean currents. Infrared radiation, radiating out
from the warmed surface of the Earth, gets trapped by greenhouse gases
and further affects the energy flow. The Sun is also the major source
of energy for organisms. Plants, algae, and cyanobacteria use sunlight to produce organic matter from carbon dioxide and water, powering the biosphere's food chains. We release this food energy
using chemical reactions, like combustion and respiration. At each level in a food chain,
some energy is stored in newly made chemical structures, but most is lost to the surroundings, as heat, like your body heat, released by your digestion of food. Now, as plants are eaten
by primary consumers, only about 10% of their total energy
is passed on to the next level. Since energy can only flow
in one direction in a food chain, from producers on to consumers
and decomposers, an organism that eats lower
on the food chain, is more efficient than one higher up. So eating producers
is the most efficient level at which an animal can get its energy, but without continual input of energy
to those producers, mostly from sunlight, life on Earth as we know it
would cease to exist. We humans, of course, spend our energy
doing a lot of things besides eating. We travel, we build, we power
all sorts of technology. To do all this, we use sources like fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas, which contain energy that plants captured
from sunlight long ago and stored in the form of carbon. When we burn fossil fuels in power plants, we release this stored energy to generate electricity. To generate electricity, heat from burning fossil fuels
is used to power turbines that rotate magnets, which, in turn, create
magnetic field changes relative to a coil of wire, causing electrons to be
induced to flow in the wire. Modern civilization depends on our ability to keep powering that flow of electrons. Fortunately, we aren't limited
to burning non-renewable fossil fuels to generate electricity. Electrons can also be induced to flow by direct interaction
with light particles, which is how a solar cell operates. Other renewable energy sources, such as wind, water, geothermal, and biofuels can also be used to generate electricity. Global demand for energy is increasing, but the planet
has limited energy resources to access through a complex
energy infrastructure. As populations rise, alongside rates of industrialization
and development, our energy decisions grow
more and more important. Access to energy
impacts health, education, political power, and socioeconomic status. If we improve our energy efficiency, we can use our natural resources
more responsibly and improve quality of life for everyone."
60,4Vfn5CV9juI,How to speak monkey: The language of cotton-top tamarins - Anne Savage,"Living with her family high above the ground in the northern tropical forests of Colombia, you will find Shakira, a cotton-top tamarin with a penchant for conversation. Say, ""Hola!"" Though you may not realize it, this one pound monkey communicates in a highly sophisticated language of 38 distinct calls based on variations of chirps and whistles. The response she just gave is known as a ""B chirp"", a call often directed at humans. To appreciate the complexities of Shakira's language, let's learn a few chirps and whistles, then examine how their combinations form grammatically structured sequences. The chirp Shakira used to greet us comes from a class of calls known as single frequency modulated syllables. This class is made up of short duration calls, or chirps, and long duration calls, like screams and squeals. Researchers have determined that there are eight different types of chirps categorized by stem upsweep, duration, peak frequency, and frequency change. In addition, each chirp has its own unique meaning. For example, Shakira's ""C chirp"" is used when she is approaching food, where as her ""D chirp"" is only used when she has the food in hand. Single whistles also exhibit a unique intention with each call and just as there are eight different chirps, there are five different whistles. Based on frequency modulation, single whistles are subdivided into four categories: squeaks, initially modulated whistles, terminally modulated whistles, and flat whistles. The language's quality of unique intention is wonderfully exemplified by the category of initially modulated whistles. These whistles change based on the proximity of Shakira to other members of her family. If Shakira is greater than .6 meters from her family, she'll sound a large initally modulated whistle. But if she's less than .6 meters from her family, she'll sound a small initially modulated whistle. Now that we've learned a few chirps and whistles, Shakira wants to show off by taking you through a quick day in her life with these calls. While heading towards a feeding tree for her first meal of the day, she says, (monkey noise), a call most often used in relaxed investigations. However, suddenly she spots the shadow of a hawk. ""E chirp"" for alarm. This call alerts her family to the presence of this predator, and Shakira jumps to the safety of an inner branch. The coast seems clear, so Shakira makes her way towards her dad. Wait, wait. Who is that? Ah, it's her younger brother, Carlos. Cotton-top tamarins often squeal during play wrestling. Uh-oh. He's playing a little too roughly, and Shakira screams, alerting her parents to help her. Her dad makes his way towards the ball of rolling fur and her brother stops. Shakira shakes herself and scratches herself to get the hair on her head back in place. Then Shakira spots another group of unfamiliar tamarins and hears their normal long call. She turns to her family. (Monkey noise) Did you catch that? First there was a chirp, then a whistle. This is what's known as a combination vocalization, a phrase that contains both a chirp and a whistle. These are two calls strung together to convey a message. The combination of these two elements alerts her family to the presence of another group, the ""F chirp"", and the distance they are away, the normal long call whistle. In other words, Shakira just said a sentence. Her simple demonstration is just the tip of the iceberg. She's got trills, chatters, multiple whistle calls, more combination vocalizations, even twitters. Yet sadly enough, we may not get to hear everything she has to say. Mixed in with chirping sonatas from high above is the constant thud of a machete chopping trees. Shakira's habitat in Colombia is being cut down, piece by piece, and if we don't work to protect the critically endangered cotton-top tamarin, it will become extinct in our lifetime. If the chirp from one tamarin to the next has proven to be more than just idle chit chat, imagine what else we have left to discover. Imagine what else Shakira can tell us."
61,Vd4rgN6MYtg,Attack of the killer algae - Eric Noel Muñoz,"We've all seen the movies where a monster, created by a scientist in a laboratory, escapes to wreak havoc on the outside world. But what if the monster was not some giant rampaging beast, destroying a city, but just a tiny amount of seaweed with the potential to disrupt entire coastal ecosystems? This is the story of Caulerpa taxifolia, originally a naturally occurring seaweed native to tropical waters. In the 1980s, one strain was found to thrive in colder environments. This trait, combined with its beautiful, bright green color and ability to grow quickly without maintenance made it ideal for aquariums, which it helped keep clean by consuming nutrients and chemicals in the water. Further selective breeding made it even heartier, and soon it was used in aquariums around the world. But it was not long before a sample of this aquarium-developed super algae turned up in the Mediterranean Sea near the famed Oceanographic Museum of Monaco. The marine biologist who found it believed that the museum had accidentally realeased it into the ocean along with aquarium waters, while museum directors claimed it had be carried into the area by ocean currents. Regardless of how it ended up there, the non-native Caulerpa multiplied rapidly, having no natural predators due to releasing a toxin that keeps fish away. And like some mythical monster, even a tiny piece that broke off could grow into a whole new colony. Through water currents and contact with boat anchors and fishing lines, it fragmented and spread throughout Mediterranean coastal cities covering coral reefs. So what was the result of this invasion? Well, it depends on who you ask. Many scientists warned that the spread of Caulerpa reduces biodiversity by crowding out native species of seaweed that are eaten by fish, with the biologist who first discovered its presence dubbing it Killer Algae. Other studies instead claim that the algae actually had a beneficial effect by consuming chemical pollutants -- one reason the aquariums strain was developed. But the disruption of a natural ecosystem by an introduced foreign species can have unpredictable and uncontrollable effects that may not be immediately visible. So when Culerpa taxifolia was discovered at Carlsbad's Agua Hedionda Lagoon, near San Diego in the year 2000, having most likely come from the dumping of home aquarium water into a connecting storm drain, it was decided to stop it before it spread. Tarps were placed over the Culerpa colonies and chlorine injected inside. Although this method killed all other marine life trapped under the tarps, it did succeed in eradicating the algae and native eelgrass was able to emerge in its place. By responding quickly, authorities in California were able to prevent Culerpa from propagating. But another occurrence of the strain, in the coastal wetlands of southeast Australia, was left unchecked and allowed to spread. And unfortunately, a tarp cannot cover the Mediterranean Sea or the Australian coast. Invasive species are not a new problem, and can indeed occur naturally. But when such species are the results of human directed selective breeding or genetic modification and then released into the natural environment, their effect on ecosystems can be far more radical and irreversible. With the proliferation of new technologies and multiple threats to the environment, it is more important than ever for scientists to monitor and evaluate the risks and dangers, and for the rest of us to remember that what starts in our backyard can effect ecosystems half a world away."
62,Y5uRVv7GGQM,How bees help plants have sex - Fernanda S. Valdovinos,"Bees are very busy little matchmakers. Wingmen in every sense of the word. You see, the bees' side of the whole ""birds and the bees"" business is to help plants find mates and reproduce. In their work as pollinators, honeybees are integral to the production of nearly 1/3 of the food that we eat. And these bees, dutifully helping lonely plants have sex, aren't alone. But rather are part of a very complex network of matchmaking creatures, critical for the pollination of natural ecosystems and crops. Plants in many natural ecosystems need help to have sex. Like many of us, they're too busy to find a relationship. They have too much photosynthesis to do, and they can't find the time to evolve feet and walk to a singles bar. Those places are called meat markets for a reason, because plants can't walk. So they need matchmaker pollinators to transport their pollen grains to flowers of the same plant species, and they pay these pollinators with food. Today, around 170,000 plant species receive pollination services from more than 200,000 pollinator species. Pollinators include many species of bees, butterflies, moths, flies, wasps, beetles, even birds and bats, who together help pollinate many species of trees, shrubs and other flowering plants. In return, flowering plants are an abundant and diverse food source for pollinators. For instance, fossil records suggest bees may have evolved from wasps that gave up hunting after they acquired a taste for nectar. Plant pollinator networks are everywhere. Ecologists record these networks in the field by observing which pollinators visit which plants, or by analyzing the identity of pollen loads on their bodies. Networks, registered in these ways, contain from 20 to 800 species. These networks show a repeated structure, or architecture. Pollinators interact with plants in a very heterogenous way. Most plants are specialists, they have only one or a few matchmakers. Meanwhile, only a few generalist plants hire a diverse team of matchmakers, getting visits from almost all the pollinators of the network. The same occurs with pollinators. Most are specialists that feed on only a few plant species, while a few pollinators, including the honeybee usually, are generalists, busily feeding from and matchmaking for almost all the plant species in that ecosystem. What's interesting is that specialists and generalists across both plants and pollinators, sort themselves out in a particular pattern. Most pollinator networks, for which we have data, are nested. In a nested network, specialists tend to interact more with generalists than with other specialists. This is because if you're a specialist plant, and your only matchmaker also specializes on you as its only food source, you're each more vulnerable to extinction. So, you're better off specializing on a generalist pollinator that has other sources of food to ensure its persistence in bad years. The same goes if you're a specialist pollinator. You're better off in the long run specializing on a generalist plant that gets pollinated by other species in times when you're not around to help. Finally, in addition to nestedness, the networks are usually modular. This means that the species in a network are compartmentalized into modules of plants and animals that interact more with each other than with species in other modules. Think of them like social cliques. A plant or pollinator dying off will effect the species in its module, but those effects will be less severe on the rest of the network. Why's all that important? Because plant pollinator network structure effects the stability of ecosystems. Heterogeneous distribution, nestedness and modularity enable networks to better prevent and respond to extinctions. That's critical because nature is never static. Some species may not show up every year. Plants flower at different times. Pollinators mature on varying schedules. Generalist pollinators have to adapt their preferences depending on who's flowering when. So from one flowering season to the next, the participants and patterns of matchmaking can drastically change. With all those variables, you can understand the importance of generalist pollinators, like bees, to the stability of not only a crop harvest, but the entire network of plants and pollinators we see in nature, and rely on for life. Next time you see a bee fly by, remember that it belongs to a complex network of matchmakers critical to the love lives of plants all around you."
63,hDNlu7Qf6_E,The colossal consequences of supervolcanoes - Alex Gendler,"The year was 1816. Europe and North America had just been through a devastating series of wars, and a slow recovery seemed to be underway, but nature had other plans. After two years of poor harvests, the spring brought heavy rains and cold, flooding the rivers and causing crop failures from the British Isles to Switzerland. While odd-colored snow fell in Italy and Hungary, famine, food riots and disease epidemics ensued. Meanwhile, New England was blanketed by a strange fog that would not disperse as the ground remained frozen well into June. In what came to be known as ""the Year Without a Summer,"" some thought the apocalypse had begun. A mood captured in Lord Byron's poem ""Darkness"": ""I had a dream which was not all a dream. The bright sun was extinguish'd, and the stars did wander darkling in the eternal space, rayless, and pathless, and the icy Earth swung blind and blackening in the moonless air; morn came and went -- and came, and brought no day."" They had no way of knowing that the real source of their misfortunes had occurred a year ago thousands of miles away. The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora on the Indonesian island of Sumbawa was what is known as a supervolcano, characterized by a volume of erupted material, many times greater than that of ordinary volcanoes. And while the popular image of volcanic destruction is molten rock engulfing the surrounding land, far greater devastation is caused by what remains in the air. Volcanic ash, dispersed by wind, can blanket the sky for days, while toxic gases, such as sulfur dioxide, react in the stratosphere, blocking out solar radiation and drastically cooling the atmosphere below. The resulting volcanic winter, along with other effects such as acid rain, can effect multiple continents, disrupting natural cycles and annihilating the plant life on which other organisms, including humans, depend. Releasing nearly 160 cubic kilometers of rock, ash and gas, the Mount Tambora eruption was the largest in recorded history, causing as many as 90,000 deaths. But previous eruptions have been even more deadly. The 1600 eruption of Peru's Huaynaputina is likely to have triggered the Russian famine, that killed nearly two million, while more ancient eruptions have been blamed for major world events, such as the fall of the Chinese Xia Dynasty, the disappearance of the Minoan civilization, and even a genetic bottleneck in human evolution that may have resulted from all but a few thousand human beings being wiped out 70,000 years ago. One of the most dangerous types of supervolcano is an explosive caldera, formed when a volcanic mountain collapses after an eruption so large that the now-empty magma chamber can no longer support its weight. But though the above-ground volcano is gone, the underground volcanic activity continues. With no method of release, magma and volcanic gases continue to accumulate and expand underground, building up pressure until a massive and violent explosion becomes inevitable. And one of the largest active volcanic calderas lies right under Yellowstone National Park. The last time it erupted, 650,000 years ago, it covered much of North America in nearly two meters of ash and rock. Scientists are currently monitoring the world's active volcanoes, and procedures for predicting eruptions, conducting evacuations and diverting lava flows have improved over the years. But the massive scale and global reach of a supervolcano means that for many people there would be nowhere to run. Fortunately, the current data shows no evidence of such an eruption occurring in the next few thousand years. But the idea of a sudden and unavoidable civilization-destroying apocalypse caused by events half a globe away will remain a powerful and terrifying vision. Less fictional than we would like to believe. ""The winds were withered in the stagnant air, and the clouds perish'd; darkness had no need of aid from them -- she was the universe."" - Lord Byron"
