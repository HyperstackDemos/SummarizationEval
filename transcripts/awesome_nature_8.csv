0,W9wAfqBd_T0,How turtle shells evolved... twice - Judy Cebra Thomas,"Meet Odontochelys semitestacea. This little creature spends its days 
splashing in Late Triassic swamps with a host of other reptiles. Under the surface lies its best 
defense against attack: a hard shell on its belly. Odontochelys is an early ancestor 
of the turtle. Its half-shelled body illustrates an 
important point about the modern turtle: it actually has two shells that develop 
totally separately while the turtle is still an embryo. Both are extensions of the animal’s 
skeleton, and together they are made 
of almost 60 bones. Like other embryos, turtle embryos are made of 
undifferentiated cells that become specific cell types, and then organs and tissues, through gene activity and communication
between cells. At first, turtle embryos look very similar
to those of other reptiles, birds, and mammals, except for a bulge of cells called 
the carapacial ridge. The ridge expands around the body 
between the neck and lower back, creating a disc shape. It guides the formation of the upper part
of the turtle’s shell, called the carapace, likely by attracting 
the cells that will become ribs. Instead of curving downwards 
to make a regular rib cage, the ribs move outwards towards the 
carapacial ridge. They then secrete a signaling protein that converts surrounding cells 
into bone-forming cells. These fifty bones grow until they meet 
and connect with sutures. A ring of bone solidifies 
the carapace’s edges. The outer layer of skin cells produces 
the scales, known as scutes, that cover the carapace. The development of the bottom half 
of the shell, the plastron, is driven by neural crest cells, which can produce a variety of different 
cell types including neurons, cartilage and bone. A thick shield of these cells 
spreads across the belly, coming together in regions that produce
nine plate-like bones. Eventually, these connect to the 
carapace by sutures. A turtle’s shell has obvious advantages
for guarding against predators, but the rigid casing also presents 
some challenges. As the turtle grows, the sutures between the bones 
of the carapace and plastron spread. Most mammals and reptiles rely on a
flexible rib cage that expands to allow them to breathe, but turtles use abdominal muscles 
attached to the shell instead: one to breathe in, 
and one to breathe out. So how did the shell evolve? Though there are still gaps in the 
fossil record, the first step seems to have been 
a thickening of the ribs. The oldest known turtle ancestor, a creature called Eunotosaurus africanus, lived 260 million years ago and looked 
almost nothing like a modern turtle, but it had a set of broad, flat ribs that anchored the muscles 
of its powerful forearms. Eunotosaurus was likely 
a burrowing creature, digging homes for itself in what’s 
now southern Africa. Odontochelys semitestacea illustrates 
another, later step in turtle evolution, with thick ribs like Eunotosaurus 
plus a belly plate for protection. Our first fossil evidence of the full 
shell characteristic of modern turtles is about 210 million years old, and belongs to a species called 
Proganochelys quenstedti, whose ribs had fused. Proganochelys could move 
between water and land. Unlike modern turtles, it couldn’t retract
its head into its shell, but had defensive spines on its neck. Modern turtle shells are almost as diverse
as the turtles themselves. Sea turtles have flatter, lighter shells 
for streamlined gliding through the water. Land-dwelling tortoises, meanwhile, have domed shells that can slip free of
predators’ jaws and help them turn right-side up if 
they fall on their backs. Leatherback and softshell turtles have shells without the ring of bone 
around the edge of the carapace or the tough scutes covering it, making it easier for them to 
squeeze into tight spaces."
1,Cd-artSbpXc,Why are fish fish-shaped? - Lauren Sallan,"In tropical seas, flying fish leap out of the water, gliding for up to 200 meters 
using wing-like fins, before dipping back into the sea. In the Indo-Pacific, a hunting sailfish can reach speeds 
of 110 kilometers per hour. That’s 11 times faster than Olympic 
swimming champion Michael Phelps. It can then stick up its spiny dorsal fin 
like a brake, grinding to a dead halt, mid-swim. Each of these physical feats is made 
possible by a fish’s form, which in most species is a smooth, 
elongated body, fins, and a tail. These features are shared across thousands
of fish species, each introducing its own variations on
the theme to survive in unique habitats. What makes these features so
commonplace in fish, and what does it reveal about the more 
than 33,000 fish species that inhabit earth’s rivers, 
lakes, and seas? Fish can be split into two main groups, according to the type 
of motion they favor. The first is body 
and caudal fin driven motion, and most fish species, about 85%, 
fall into this group. Here, the body and tail 
are the primary propelling forces, with fins mainly playing 
a stabilizing and steering role. This configuration suits 
many open-water species, which need speed, thrust and control for
constant, efficient swimming. Eels lie at one extreme of this group. Known as anguilliform swimmers, their entire bodies undulate to generate 
a wave-like motion. Compared to anguilliform fish, species like salmon and trout, 
known as subcarangiforms, use about two-thirds of their body mass
to generate motion, while carangiform swimmers, 
such as mackerel, only use about a third. Typically, the less of its mass a fish 
uses to generate motion, the more streamlined its shape. At the other end of the spectrum from eels
are ostraciiform species like boxfish, and thunniform swimmers like tuna. In these fish, the tails, 
also known as caudal fins, do the work. A tuna’s tail is attached by tendons 
to multiple muscles in its body. It powers the body like an engine, forcefully catapulting
the bullet-like fish to speeds up to 69 kilometers per hour. The second major fish group relies 
on median and paired fin motion, meaning they’re propelled through the 
water predominantly by their fins. Fins allow fine-tuned movement 
at slow speeds, so this propulsion 
is typically found in fish that have to navigate complex habitats. Bottom-dwelling fishes, like rays,
fall into this group; using their huge pectoral fins, they can
lift themselves swiftly off the sea floor. That conveniently allows them 
to inhabit shallow seas without being buffeted about by waves. Similarly, shallow-water flatfish 
use their entire bodies as one big fin to hoist 
themselves up off the sand. Ocean sunfish lack tails, so they move around slowly by beating 
their wing-like median fins instead. Similar movements are shared 
by many reef species, like the queen angelfish, surgeonfish, and wrasse. Their focus on fins has taken 
the demand off their bodies, many of which have consequently 
evolved into unusual and inventive shapes. There are fishes within both groups 
that seem to be outliers. But if you look closer, you’ll notice that these 
common traits are disguised. Seahorses, for instance, don’t appear 
fish-shaped in any conventional way, yet they use their flexible 
dorsal fins as makeshift tails. A pufferfish may occasionally 
look more like a lethal balloon, but if it needs to swim rapidly,
it’ll retract its spines. Handfish look like they have legs, but really these limb-like 
structures are fins, modified to help them 
amble across the sea floor. For fish, motion underpins survival, so it’s become a huge evolutionary 
driver of form. The widespread features of fish 
have been maintained across tens of thousands of fish species, not to mention other 
ocean-dwelling animals, like penguins, dolphins, sea slugs, and squids. And that’s precisely because 
they’ve proven so successful."
2,_hBAr7uJ6L8,The surprising reasons animals play dead - Tierney Thys,"Imagine you’re being attacked 
by a ferocious predator. With no chance of escape, you do what any courageous, 
self-respecting possum would do: curl into an immobile 
state called catatonia, stick out your tongue, drool, and ooze some foul-smelling 
liquid from your anal glands. Disgusted, your assailant 
loosens its grip, decides you’re not the dinner 
it was looking for, and departs. After 10 minutes, 
you resurrect and merrily saunter on. From lemurs to lizards, ants to amphibians, sharks to chickens, hundreds of animals
""play dead"" as a survival tactic. Nicknamed ""playing possum"" 
after its star performer, feigning death is also called thanatosis. That’s from Thanatos, 
the ancient Greek deity of death. But most scientists call it 
tonic immobility, or TI. How and why TI occurs depends 
on the species and situation. Spewing stench and adopting odd postures
are common and often play important roles. Other animals sacrifice their neighbors: quail chicks that freeze 
while their kin run amok have a better chance of survival 
when pursued by a cat. Speaking of cats, feline mothers can pinch
the napes of their kittens’ necks and induce another kind of 
immobility called clipnosis. This keeps their kittens quiet 
and easy to transport. Most of the physiological mechanisms 
underlying these theatrics originate in 
the parasympathetic nervous system, better known for controlling cycles 
of resting and digesting. In possums, the parasympathetic nervous system causes
their heart rates to drop by nearly half, respiration by a third, and body temperatures by more than half a
degree Celsius for up to an hour. The neurotransmitter dopamine 
also plays a part. Flour beetles with low dopamine levels 
play dead more frequently than those with high levels, and anything blocking dopamine receptor 
sites can lengthen catatonia. But maintaining a death ruse isn’t easy. The performers are constantly 
gauging their surroundings for cues on when it’s safe to rise. Chickens, for instance, can sense
when a predator’s eyes are upon them. Researchers know this because when they
used a stuffed hawk in an experiment, their chicken subjects came out of their
catatonia quicker when the hawk’s eyes were averted. Other animals use TI for purposes 
other than defense. When the sleeper cichlid feels peckish, it sinks to the lake floor 
and lies motionless, its splotchy coloration making it 
seem like a rotting carcass. If a small scavenger investigates, 
this undead trickster strikes. Some animals even feign death 
as a sexual ploy. Male nursery spiders offer gifts of
silk-wrapped insects in hopes of wooing females. But those females are known 
to eat love-seeking males. By playing dead while the female 
eagerly devours her snack, these males can cautiously revive and improve their chances 
of successfully mating. So TI can work to an animal’s advantage,
unless someone else knows its secret. California orcas can flip over 
young great white sharks, inducing TI for so long 
the immobilized sharks, who must move to respire, 
essentially suffocate. Humans can also flip sharks into TI. By stroking a shark’s 
electrically-sensitive snout and gently turning it over, researchers can induce TI 
that lasts up to 15 minutes. That’s enough time to insert tags, remove hooks, and even perform surgeries. There are risks however: TI can hamper respiration and induce
hyperglycemia, a sign of stress. So this technique should only 
be used when necessary. Humans can also experience TI when they
freeze with fear during violent assaults. Recognizing this ancient, involuntary
form of self-defense has significant implications 
when trying to understand why some victims don’t flee 
or fight in the face of danger. So, studying TI in non-human animals not only helps us better understand some
odd behaviors, it can also help us better 
understand our own, sometimes counterintuitive, responses to violence."
3,uSTNyHkde08,Why isn't the world covered in poop? - Eleanor Slade and Paul Manning,"Somewhere near you, 
an animal is defecating. In fact, each day, the animal kingdom 
produces roughly enough dung to match the volume of water pouring 
over the Victoria Falls. So why isn’t the planet covered 
in the stuff? You can thank the humble dung beetle 
for eating up the excess. Capable of burying 250 times 
their body weight in a single night, these valiant insects make
quick work of an endless stream of feces. Over 7,000 known species of dung beetle 
run clean-up duty across six continents —everywhere except Antarctica. A dung beetle’s first task 
is to locate dung. Some live on the anal regions 
of larger animals, ready to leap off when they defecate. Others sniff out feces 
that animals leave behind. A pile of elephant dung can attract 
4,000 beetles in 15 minutes. So once a beetle finds dung, it must work quickly to secure 
some of the bounty for itself. Most dung beetle species fall into one 
of three main groups: rollers, tunnelers, and dwellers. Dung rollers sculpt a ball of dung,
and using their back legs, quickly roll it away from competitors. Potential partners jump on the ball, and once the ball-maker 
has selected their mate, the pair dig their dung ball 
into the soil. Once it’s been buried, the female lays 
a single egg within the dung ball. Tunnelers have a different approach. Digging underneath a pat, 
some drag dung down into the soil and pack it into clumps 
known as brood balls, dung balls, or dung “sausages,” 
depending on their shape and size. Male tunnelers sport a spectacular 
array of horns to fight each other
for control of these tunnels, which they then defend 
until the female’s laid her egg. Some male tunnelers avoid the fray
by masquerading as hornless females and sneaking into tunnels to mate 
while the guardians’ heads are turned. The third group of dung beetles, dwellers, take the most straightforward approach, laying their eggs
directly into a dung pat. This makes their offspring
more vulnerable to predation than those of the tunnelers and rollers. As the larvae feed, they riddle 
the dung pat with tunnels, leaving remains that are quickly colonized
by bacteria and fungi and weathered away. Inside a tunnel, ball, or pat, 
once the larvae hatch, they consume the dung 
before metamorphosing into a pupa and then an adult beetle. Besides clearing dung, 
the actions of these beetles have considerable ecological importance. For one, they serve as secondary 
seed dispersers. Dung from monkeys, wild pigs, and other animals is riddled with seeds 
from the fruits they eat. When beetles bury their dung balls, they inadvertently protect these seeds 
from predators and increase the likelihood 
they’ll germinate. The advantage is so great 
that one South African plant has evolved to produce seeds that look 
and smell like dung to trick beetles into burying them. Dung beetles also play important roles 
in agricultural systems. Livestock, like cows and sheep,
produce huge amounts of dung, which contains nutrients 
that can benefit plants. The beetles break up the dung 
and tunnel it deep into the soil, bringing the nutrients into close contact
with plant roots. Their services to farmers have been valued
at $380 million a year in the US and £367 million a year in the UK. Dung beetles can even help us battle 
global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions
associated with farming. Microbes living in oxygen-poor 
livestock dung produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas. But beetles oxygenate pats when 
they tunnel into them, preventing the microbes
from producing methane. The dung beetle spreads seeds, helps farmers, and fights climate change —and accomplishes it all
simply by doing its business. Maybe next time you come across 
some dung in the forest or a field, you’ll be tempted to take a closer look."
4,-64U7WoBrqM,Why are sloths so slow? - Kenny Coogan,"In 1796, Thomas Jefferson received
a box of bones he couldn't identify. A long, sharp claw reminded him of a lion, but the arm bones 
suggested a larger animal, one about three meters long. Thinking it might be huge unknown
species of North American lion, Jefferson warned explorers Lewis and Clark to keep an eye out 
for this mysterious predator. But Jefferson's box of bones didn't
come from a lion. They came from an extinct giant sloth. Prehistoric ground sloths first appeared
around 35 million years ago. Dozens of species lived across
North, Central and South America, alongside other ancient creatures
like mastodons and giant armadillos. Some ground sloths, like the megalonychid,
were cat-sized, but many were massive. Jefferson's sloth, Megalonyx,
weighed about a ton, and that was small 
compared to megatherium, which could reach six metric tons,
as much as an elephant. They ambled through the forests
and savannas using their strong arms and sharp claws to uproot plants and climb trees, grazing on grasses, leaves,
and prehistoric avocados. In fact, we might not have avocados
today if not for the giant sloths. Smaller animals couldn't swallow
the avocado's huge seed, but the sloths could, and they spread avocado trees
far and wide. Ground sloths flourished for millions
of years, but around 10,000 years ago,
they started disappearing along with the Western Hemisphere's
other giant mammals. Researchers think that ground sloths
could have been pushed out by an oncoming ice age, or competition with other species,
maybe humans, who arrived in the region around the time
most of the sloths went extinct. Some of the smaller sloths did survive
and migrated to the treetops. Today, there are six species left
living in the rainforest canopies of Central and South America. Hanging out in the trees is a good way
to avoid predators, and there are plenty of leaves to eat. But this diet has its drawbacks. Animals extract energy from food
and use that energy to move around, maintain their body temperature, keep their organs working, and all the other activities necessary
for survival. But leaves don't contain much energy, and that which they do have
is tough to extract. Most herbivores supplement a leafy diet
with higher energy foods like fruit and seeds. But sloths, especially three-toed sloths,
rely on leaves almost exclusively. They've evolved finely tuned strategies
for coping with this restricted diet. First, they extract as much energy from
their food as possible. Sloths have a multi-chambered stomach
that takes up a third of their body, and depending on the species, they can spend five to seven days,
or even weeks, processing a meal. The other piece of the puzzle
is to use as little energy as possible. One way sloths do this is, of course,
by not moving very much. They spend most of their time eating,
resting, or sleeping. They descend from the canopy just once
a week for a bathroom break. When sloths do move, it's not very fast. It would take a sloth about five minutes
to cross an average neighborhood street. This unhurried approach to life means
that sloths don't need very much muscle. In fact, they have about 30% less
muscle mass than other animals their size. Sloths also use less energy 
to keep themselves warm because their body temperature
can fluctuate by about five degrees Celsius, less than a cold-blooded reptile,
but more than most mammals. These physical and behavioral adaptations 
minimize the sloth's energy expenditure, or metabolic rate. Three-toed sloths have the slowest 
metabolism of any mammal. The giant panda is second slowest, and two-toed sloths come in third. Moving slowly has allowed sloths
to thrive in their treetop habitat. But it's also made the sloths themselves
a great habitat for other organisms, including algae, which provides a little
extra camouflage, and maybe even a snack. Sloths may not be giant anymore, but that doesn't make 
them any less remarkable."
5,vcPJkz-D5II,The evolution of animal genitalia - Menno Schilthuizen,"The evolutionary tango 
of animal genitalia. Can you guess what you're looking at? If you answered ""duck vagina,""
you'd be right. Although the bird's outward appearance
may not strike you as especially odd, it uses this strange, intricate, cork-screw shaped contraption 
to reproduce. We see similarly unbelievable genitalia
in insects, mammals, reptiles, fish, spiders, and even snails. Apparently, no organs evolve
faster and into more variable shapes than those involved in procreation. Superficially, it makes sense
because evolution works via reproduction. When an animal leaves more offspring,
its genes will spread. And since genitalia are an animal's tools
for reproduction, any improvement there 
will have immediate effect. And yet, what's the point of having
such decorative nether regions? After all, the function 
of genitalia seems simple. A penis deposits a bit of sperm and a vagina receives it 
and delivers it to the egg. A pipette-like thingy on the male and a funnel-like gizmo on the female
should do just fine for any animal. And yet, that's not what we see. The penis of a chicken flea, for example,
looks nothing like a pipette, more like an exploded grandfather clock. And the vagina of a featherwing beetle resembles something you'd find
in a Dr. Seuss book. Throughout the animal kingdom, genitalia are very complex things, much more complicated than seems
necessary for what they're meant to do. That's because genitalia do more than just
deposit and receive sperm. Many male animals also use the penis
as courtship device, like crane flies. In some South American species, males have a tiny washboard and scraper
on their penis, which produces a song that reverberates
throughout the female's body when they mate. It's thought that if female crane flies
enjoy this unusual serenade, they'll allow the male 
to father their offspring. This way, the genes of the most
musical penises spread, leading to rapid evolution
of insects' phalluses. Similarly, some beetles have two little
drumsticks on either side of the penis. During mating, they'll rub, slap, or tap
the female with these. And some hoofed mammals,
like rams and bulls, use a whip-like extension 
on the penis's left side to create a sensation during mating. But how can females really choose
between males if she can only assess them after mating? This is where the power
of female adaptation comes into play. In fact, insemination is different
to conception, and the female genitalia exploit
this distinction. For instance, in some dung flies, the vagina contains pockets
for separating sperm from different males depending on how appealing they were. Males using their penises for courtship and females controlling 
their own sperm management are two reasons why genitalia evolve
into such complex shapes. But there are others because genitalia are also where
a sexual conflict is played out. A female's interests are best served if
she fertilizes her eggs with the sperm of the best fathers and creates genetic variability amongst
her offspring. For a male, on the other hand,
this is bad news. For him, it would be best if a female
used his sperm to fertilize all of her eggs. So we see cycles of adaptation
in an evolutionary arms race to retain control. Black widow spiders 
have a disposable penis tip that breaks off inside the vagina
blocking the attempts of his rivals, and bed bug males bypass a female's
genitalia altogether using a syringe-like penis to inject
sperm cells directly into her belly. Not to be outdone, females have evolved 
their own countermeasures. In some bed bug species, the females have evolved an entirely
new set of genitalia on their right hand flanks
where the males usually pierce them. That allows them to maintain
the power to filter out unwanted sperm with their genitalia. And duck vaginas are shaped
like a clockwise spiral so that when the male inflates his long,
counterclockwise coiled penis into her, and she disapproves, all she needs to do 
is flex her vaginal muscles and the penis just flubs out. So, genitalia differs so much,
not just to fascinate us, but because in every species, they're the result of 
a furious evolutionary tango of sex that has been going on
for millions of years and will continue for millions 
of years to come."
6,IxndOd3kmSs,"Meet the tardigrade, the toughest animal on Earth - Thomas Boothby","Without water, a human can only
survive for about 100 hours. But there's a creature so resilient
that it can go without it for decades. This one millimeter animal can survive
both the hottest and coldest environments on Earth, and can even withstand high levels
of radiation. This is the tardigrade, and it's one of the toughest creatures
on Earth, even if it does look more like
a chubby, eight-legged gummy bear. Most organisms need water to survive. Water allows metabolism to occur, which is the process that drives
all the biochemical reactions that take place in cells. But creatures like the tardigrade,
also known as the water bear, get around this restriction
with a process called anhydrobiosis, from the Greek meaning
life without water. And however extraordinary,
tardigrades aren't alone. Bacteria, single-celled organisms called archaea, plants, and even other animals 
can all survive drying up. For many tardigrades, this requires that they go through 
something called a tun state. They curl up into a ball, pulling their head and eight legs
inside their body and wait until water returns. It's thought that as water
becomes scarce and tardigrades enter their tun state, they start synthesize special molecules, which fill the tardigrade's cells
to replace lost water by forming a matrix. Components of the cells that are
sensitive to dryness, like DNA, proteins, and membranes, get trapped in this matrix. It's thought that this keeps these
molecules locked in position to stop them from unfolding, breaking apart, or fusing together. Once the organism is rehydrated,
the matrix dissolves, leaving behind undamaged, 
functional cells. Beyond dryness, tardigrades can also
tolerate other extreme stresses: being frozen, heated up past the boiling point
of water, high levels of radiation, and even the vacuum of outer space. This has led to some erroneous speculation that tardigrades 
are extraterrestrial beings. While that's fun to think about, scientific evidence places their
origin firmly on Earth where they've evolved over time. In fact, this earthly evolution 
has given rise to over 1100 known species of tardigrades and there are probably many others
yet to be discovered. And because tardigrades are so hardy,
they exist just about everywhere. They live on every continent,
including Antarctica. And they're in diverse biomes
including deserts, ice sheets, the sea, fresh water, rainforests, and the highest mountain peaks. But you can find tardigrades
in the most ordinary places, too, like moss or lichen found in yards, parks, and forests. All you need to find them is a little
patience and a microscope. Scientists are now to trying to find out
whether tardigrades use the tun state, their anti-drying technique, to survive other stresses. If we can understand how they,
and other creatures, stabilize their sensitive 
biological molecules, perhaps we could apply this knowledge
to help us stabilize vaccines, or to develop stress-tolerant crops that 
can cope with Earth's changing climate. And by studying how tardigrades survive prolonged exposure 
to the vacuum of outer space, scientists can generate clues about
the environmental limits of life and how to safeguard astronauts. In the process, tardigrades could even
help us answer a critical question: could life survive on planets much
less hospitable than our own?"
7,VgEbcQxFUu8,Why do we harvest horseshoe crab blood? - Elizabeth Cox,"During the warmer months,
especially at night during the full moon, horseshoe crabs emerge 
from the sea to spawn. Waiting for them are teams
of lab workers who capture the horseshoe crabs
by the hundreds of thousands, take them to labs, harvest their cerulean blood, then return them to the sea. Oddly enough, we capture horseshoe crabs
on the beach because that's the only place
we know we can find them. A female horseshoe crab lays as many
as 20 batches of up to 4,000 eggs on her annual visit to the beach. When the eggs hatch, the juvenile horseshoe crabs
often stay near shore, periodically shedding their shells
as they grow. Once they leave 
these shallow waters, they don't return until they
reach sexual maturity ten years later. Despite our best efforts, we don't
know where they spend those years. Though we've spotted the occasional 
horseshoe crab as deep as 200 meters below
the ocean's surface, we only see large groups of adults
when they come ashore to spawn. Horseshoe crab blood contains
cells called amebocytes that protect them 
from infection by viruses, fungi, and bacteria. Amebocytes form gels around
these invaders to prevent them from spreading infections. This isn't unusual. All animals have protective 
immune systems. But horseshoe crab amebocytes
are exceptionally sensitive to bacterial endotoxins. Endotoxins are molecules
from the cell walls of certain bacteria, including E. coli. Large amounts of them are released
when bacterial cells die, and they can make us sick
if they enter the blood stream. Many of the medicines and medical devices
we rely on can become contaminated, so we have to test them
before they touch our blood. We do have tests called Gram stains
that detect bacteria, but they can't recognize endotoxins which can be there even when
bacteria aren't present. So scientists use an extract called LAL produced from harvested 
horseshoe crab blood to test for endotoxins. They add LAL to a medicine sample,
and if gels form, bacterial endotoxins are present. Today, the LAL test is used so widely that millions of people who've
never seen a horseshoe crab have been protected by their blood. If you've ever had an injection,
that probably includes you. How did horseshoe crabs end up
with such special blood? Like other invertebrates, the horseshoe crab has an open
circulatory system. This means their blood isn't contained
in blood vessels, like ours. Instead, horseshoe crab blood
flows freely through the body cavity and comes in direct contact with tissues. If bacteria enters their blood,
it can quickly spread over a large area. Pair this vulnerability with the horseshoe crab's bacteria-filled 
ocean and shoreline habitats, and it's easy to see why they need
such a sensitive immune response. Horseshoe crabs survived 
mass extinction events that wiped out over 90% of life on Earth
and killed off the dinosaurs, but they're not invincible. And the biggest disruptions they've faced
in millions of years come from us. Studies have shown that up to
15% of horseshoe crabs die in the process of having
their blood harvested. And recent research suggests
this number may be even higher. Researchers have also observed
fewer females returning to spawn at some of the most harvested areas. Our impact on horseshoe crabs extends
beyond the biomedical industry, too. Coastal development 
destroys spawning sites, and horseshoe crabs are also
killed for fishing bait. There's ample evidence that
their populations are shrinking. Some researchers have started working to synthesize horseshoe crab 
blood in the lab. For now, we're unlikely to stop
our beach trips, but hopefully, a synthetic alternative
will someday eliminate our reliance on the blood of these ancient creatures."
